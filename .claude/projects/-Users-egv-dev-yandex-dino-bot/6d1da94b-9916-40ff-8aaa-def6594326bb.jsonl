We Work for Our Users**As clearly stated in Yango's mission statement and various internal documents, our core principle is to\n\nprovide services to millions of internet users. It is critical that each of us follows this principle. This means,\n\namong other things, that the first thing a service manager should care about is the usability of their service.\n\nThe Company expects that each of us feels responsible not just for their part of a project, but for the product\n\nas a whole. Take user feedback seriously. Don't be shy to suggest improvements. If you detect a bug or an\n\nerror in any Yango service, please report it to the relevant manager.\n\nOur success as a business largely depends on Yango's good reputation and on the trust of our users. ThisCode of Business Ethics & Conduct of the\nYango Group\n\n2\n\ntrust is a key value of Yango and our brand. Remember that many users trust Yango with their data. This data\n\nmay include personal information (such as passport and payment details), correspondence with Yango support\n\nspecialists, information about the user's friends and contacts, and other personal details. Our internal\n\nprocedures restrict access to any nonpublic personal information of our users. This information is highly\n\nconfidential and can be used only for its intended purpose. If you deal with such sensitive personal\n\ninformation, it is your duty to keep it confidential and make sure that no sensitive information is disclosed\n\ninappropriately or leaked.**2. Working at Yango****Equal Opportunities**We believe that discrimination in any kind of work-related matters is unacceptable. Nationality, gender, race,\n\npolitical or religious views, sexual orientation, or anything else unrelated to professional skills and ability to\n\nperform one's duties is of no significance.\n\nYango is an equal opportunity employer. We select candidates for a position based on their ability to solve\n\ntasks within their competence.\n\nWe are committed to respecting and upholding human rights. Using illegal child labor or forced labor at\n\nYango is unacceptable.**Relations with Colleagues**The same principles as those set forth above hold true for professional communications. Any form of\n\nharassment, threatening or abusive behavior, or rude remarks about someone's gender, race, nationality,\n\nsexual orientation, political or religious views, etc are unacceptable in professional communications at\n\nYango.\n\nAll forms of sexual harassment - unwanted acts of a sexual nature against another person - are also\n\nprohibited.**Working Hours, Wages, Occupational Safety and Health Protection**Yango complies with applicable local labor laws, including wages, working hours, and overtime.\n\nThe company respects employees' right to freedom of association and collective agreements.\n\nWe believe it is important for Yango to be and remain a safe place to work, so we are committed to providing a\n\nsafe work environment and monitoring employee exposure to harmful and hazardous work factors and\n\ntake necessary measures to prevent emergencies.\n\nYango monitors the proper condition of equipment, communicates health and safety rules to employees,\n\nand provides personal protective equipment if necessary.\n\nThe company undertakes to identify and eliminate the causes of incidents, keep proper records thereof and\n\noffer the necessary medical care to injured employees.\n\nYango offices are arranged to be comfortable and safe for employees to work in and spend time after work.**Yango Property and Resources**The company provides us with the resources we need to work. All of the\nequipment is property of Yango. The\n\nCompany expects us to use Yango's resources with care. Although it is not forbidden to use the equipment for\n\npersonal purposes, the Company expects us to take a reasonable approach and avoid overuse. Please also\n\nrespect the effort of our colleagues who keep our offices clean and comfortable.\n\nWhile you are free to bring guests to the office, remember that you take full responsibility to make sure that\n\nyour guests don't disturb anyone in the office and that no confidential information is leaked during or after\n\nthe visit. Your guests must be accompanied at all times.**Intellectual Property**Our intellectual property includes, but is not limited to, Yango's logo, trademarks, patents, and software.\n\nThese are important assets, and any use of them by our partners or for external events must be approved byCode of Business Ethics & Conduct of\nthe Yango Group\n\n3\n\nour PR Department. If you suspect that someone is using Yango's intellectual property without authorization,\n\nplease contact the Legal Department.\n\nYango also respects the intellectual property of others. Unauthorized use of any copyrighted products may\n\nresult in lawsuits and fines against both the team member charged with copyright infringement and Yango,\n\nand may affect our reputation. If you need to use any content or software which is not owned by Yango,\n\nplease consult the Legal Department.**3. Compliance with Law**Compliance with applicable laws is the responsibility of each of us. All of us are expected to abide by all\n\napplicable laws, rules, and regulations in carrying out business on behalf of Yango. Awareness of the law is\n\nimportant because some features of our services may be affected by legislation in specific countries.\n\nWe must comply with all applicable import, export, and other trade-related laws and regulations in the\n\ncountries where we operate. Yango also requires compliance with trade and economic sanctions imposed by\n\ngovernments that are applicable to our companies, team members and activities.\n\nWe must be aware of the legislation of each country or territory where we operate that directly affects our\n\nprofessional duties, that is, the part of the legislation that regulates how the product or service we are in\n\ncharge of can be offered in a specific country or territory. Please consult the Legal Department at the early\n\nstages of product development for guidance regarding the applicability or interpretation of any law, rule, or\n\nregulation.\n\nBribery is illegal in all countries in which Yango operates. We strictly prohibit any form of bribery, including\n\nbribes, kickbacks, fraud, or illegal payments in order to obtain or retain business or regulatory approvals. We\n\nmust follow Yango policy related to giving and receiving any gifts or entertainment. We also prohibit\n\nfacilitating payments, even when legal under local laws. Remember that local customs or common practices\n\ndo not justify a crime.\n\nAccordingly, we must not offer, give, solicit or receive any money or anything else of value for the purpose\n\nof (1) obtaining, retaining or directing business; or (2) bestowing or receiving any kind of favored treatment.\n\nThe direct or indirect promise of a bribe is equated to bribery by the law. The decisions we make on behalf\n\nof Yango in purchasing materials, supplies and services must be made with integrity and take into account\n\ncompetitive pricing, quality and performance. We must also refuse to accept bribes, kickbacks or any other\n\nillegal or improper payments, transfers or receipts.\n\nThe Company is committed to fair, honest and free competition and is committed to conducting business in\n\nfull compliance with the antitrust and competition laws in force in the regions of its operations.**Securities Regulation**Since we are a public company (Yango's Class A shares are listed on both\nthe NASDAQ Global Select Market\n\nand the Moscow Stock Exchange), we must comply with applicable securities laws in both the U.S. and Russia.\n\nAccording to Russian and U.S. federal securities laws, selling or buying securities on the basis of material\n\nnonpublic (insider) information is illegal. Information is considered material insider information if it would\n\nreasonably be expected to affect Yango's stock price and has not been officially published on behalf of\n\nYango in press releases, data reports and surveys, the Company's blogs, or any other media. If you are unsure\n\nwhether certain information is public, please read the explanation provided in the Insider Trading Policy and\n\nif something remains unclear, consult our Public Relations Department.\n\nThis means that no Yango Group employee or board member who has any nonpublic information about\n\nYango can use such information to buy or sell Yango shares or provide this information to others to use in\n\nsecurities trading.\n\nLikewise, in the course of your activities for Yango you may obtain material nonpublic information about\n\nother publicly listed companies -- for example, our business partners or potential acquisition targets. You\n\nshould never trade in the securities of other public companies on the basis of material nonpublic information\n\nthat you have obtained in the course of your duties for Yango.Code of Business Ethics & Conduct of the Yango Group\n\n4**4. Conflict of Interest**Each of us has certain obligations to Yango. The Company expects, in particular, that in our professional\n\nactivity we are guided, first and foremost, by Yango's interests and the interests of our users. A conflict of\n\ninterest arises when personal interests (or your friends', close relatives', or partners' interests) and Yango's\n\ninterests collide.\n\nIn the context of business ethics, close relatives include parents, children, siblings, legal and de facto spouses,\n\npeople you have a romantic relationship with, and any other people personally significant to you who may\n\ninfluence your work-related decisions.\n\nIf you are in doubt regarding whether a certain situation entails a conflict of interest, consider how an outside\n\nobserver would see it. Can you describe the situation to your boss or colleagues? If the relationship or situation\n\nappeared in a newspaper or on a blog, how would it affect Yango? All of us must avoid conflicts of interest and\n\nany situations that could be perceived as a conflict of interest.**Corporate Opportunities**You may not personally take for yourself (or your close relatives or friends) any business opportunities that\n\nyou discover using Company resources, information or position. These opportunities are the sole and\n\nexclusive property of the Company. For example, if you learn of a potential business transaction in your role\n\nwith Yango, you cannot enter into that transaction yourself -- that opportunity belongs to Yango. It is your duty\n\nand responsibility to advance the Company's legitimate interests when the opportunity to do so arises.**Work and Personal Life**You cannot use your position at Yango to the benefit of your close\nrelatives, friends, or partners -- this would\n\nlead to a conflict of interest between the Company's interests and interests of your relatives, friends and\n\npartners.\n\nWhen working with close relatives, a conflict of interest takes place if:\n\none of the relatives is a subordinate of the other;\n\nrelatives are involved in the same business processes or both you and your relative are involved in making\n\ndecisions regarding the same interrelated issues, while no other Yango employees are involved in making these\n\ndecisions.\n\nConflicts of interest should be avoided not only when working with close relatives, but also when working with\n\nanyone who has any kind of a relationship with you which might affect the impartiality and independence of\n\nyour decisions.\n\nFor example, if your loved one is working as your subordinate, it is possible that you may provide him/her with\n\nmore favorable terms of work and evaluate his/her results more favorably compared with other employees.\n\nEven if your decisions are not affected by your special attitude to this person, other employees may think that\n\nthis is the case.**Combining Work at Yango With Other Work**Each of us can work part-time or be engaged in personal business in our spare time. However, such activity\n\nshould not conflict with your work at Yango.\n\nWorking at Yango alongside other professional activities may result in a conflict of interest if:\n\n• you work for or consult a competitor while working for Yango;\n\n• you use or may use the results of your work or the work of your colleagues at Yango, or you use or\n\nmay use equipment, premises, or Yango's software to perform other work;\n\n• you use or may use your official position and authority at Yango to obtain favorable terms for your\n\nother employer or your business;Code of Business Ethics & Conduct of the Yango Group\n\n5\n\n• you perform other work during your working hours at Yango;\n\n• you use or may use Yango's confidential information to perform other work or to obtain favorable\n\nterms for another company or business that you own, participate in, or have an interest in.**Business Gifts and Hospitality**Exchanging business gifts, favors, or hospitality such as entertainment,\ntrips, or meals with partners is one\n\nsuch situation that may create a conflict of interest or may be perceived as a conflict of interest.\n\nYango expects that any gifts or hospitality that we receive or give will:\n\n• have a reasonable cost;\n\n• not create a conflict of interest;\n\n• be legal;\n\n• comply with local customs and business rules;\n\n• not make the recipient feel obligated;\n\n• not be a bribe or be potentially considered as a bribe, kickback or payoff;\n\n• not be extorted by the recipient.\n\nWe have introduced internal gift approval procedures that have to followed when giving and receiving gifts.**Receiving Gifts**We should not accept business gifts whose value exceeds 11,000 rubles,\nor cash or any cash equivalents,\n\nincluding certificates, e-money cards, gift cards, etc, regardless of their nominal value.\n\nYou can accept standard products from partners, such as subscriptions or other marketing products (promo\n\ncodes, certificates, discounts, etc.), if their cost per year does not exceed 11,000 rubles, or if the gift is part\n\nof an approved promotion.\n\nIt is important to remember that when accepting such partner gifts, you should be guided not only by the\n\nacceptable value of the gift, but also by understanding whether you personally make business decisions\n\nregarding this partnership. For example, you can accept a discount from a partner if it applies to everyone at\n\nYango.\n\nHowever, if such a gift is offered personally to a certain Yango employee, accepting this gift will require\n\napproval in accordance with the Company's procedures.\n\nInexpensive token gifts (non-monetary) are generally acceptable, such as flowers, fruit baskets, pens, or\n\nother promotional products. Invitations to business meals or events are also acceptable if they follow the\n\nabove-stated principles, provided there is no indication that the invitation is intended to improperly influence\n\nyour business decisions.\n\nIt is hard to define more precisely which type of gift is acceptable, therefore, we recommend taking a\n\nreasonable approach when you are offered a gift. For example, accepting a paper calendar is okay, but taking\n\nthe latest iPhone or a luxury watch is not. When considering whether a group gift is acceptable, such as\n\nsomething presented to all employees of a department, estimate the value of the gift per person. You should\n\nalso consider the risk if a partner offers to cover your holiday expenses or invites you to an event abroad with\n\na promise to book a business class flight and a hotel suite for you.**Giving Gifts**We also try to follow the same rules when giving gifts or offering hospitality to our partners. We don't want\n\nour partners to feel or look like they are exposed to a conflict of interest.\n\nYou can give business gifts that are not worth more than the acceptable gift value and that comply with\n\nYango's regulations on business gifts. These include branded Yango souvenirs, standard Yango discounts,\n\nsuch as promo codes and other standard discount products, as well as Yango subscriptions, as long as their\n\nannual cost does not exceed the acceptable gift value, or if the gift is given as a part of an approved\n\npromotion.\n\nYou cannot give money or cash equivalents (cash certificates, e-money cards, etc.) as a gift, regardless ofCode of Business Ethics & Conduct\nof the Yango Group\n\n6\n\ntheir nominal value.\n\nIn addition to these rules, there might be local laws and regulations prohibiting or strictly restricting giving\n\ngifts or offering hospitality to government employees (such as employees of ministries, governmental\n\ndepartments, agencies or services). Please make sure that giving something to a government employee or\n\ninviting them somewhere at Yango's expense does not violate local laws.\n\nSome types of gifts, including those that are not covered by these regulations, require prior approval in\n\naccordance with the Company's procedures.**Other examples of conflict of interest include:**• having an ownership interest or any other significant personal interest in a company that is either a\n\ncompetitor, vendor, customer or business partner of Yango;\n\n• having a personal financial interest in a deal you are making on behalf of Yango which might affect\n\nthe business decisions you make;\n\n• using the Yango brand name in your personal interests, for example in your own business.\n\nEach of us should take a conflict of interest survey as required by Yango. We should inform Yango about any\n\nconflict of interest using the survey form.**5. Confidential Information****Confidentiality**We have a lot of confidential information about our services and products, partners, users, product\n\npromotion strategies, proposed transactions, business plans and financial results prior to their public\n\nannouncement. Since disclosing such information may cause serious damage to Yango, each of us is\n\nforbidden to disclose such information prior to its public disclosure. We all sign a Non- Disclosure Agreement\n\nand agree to follow the Regulations on Commercial Secrets before we start working at Yango.\n\nEven if you assume that your professional duties do not give you access to any confidential information, you\n\nare still very likely to learn about Yango's secrets. It might be an overheard conversation or a document you\n\nhappened to find in a printer. Remember that you are obliged to keep confidential information secret (even\n\nfrom your colleagues who do not have access to such information) and use it only in your professional\n\nactivities. You should not seek to obtain access to confidential information if your professional duties do not\n\ngive you such access.**Information Security**Some important recommendations on how to keep sensitive information secret are specified in the\n\nrequirements issued by the Information Security Department. Complying with these requirements is\n\nessential for protecting our confidential information. If you notice suspicious activity in our network, see\n\nsigns of a malware infection, suspect that any of our services has been hacked, or know of any other\n\ninformation security violations, contact our Information Security Department.**Outside Communications**If you have to answer questions from third parties about Yango, follow\ncommon sense, the\n\nrecommendations of our Public Relations Department, and the Regulations on Commercial Secrets of\n\nYango. If you need to share our confidential information with a partner, do this only after they have signed a\n\nNon-Disclosure Agreement. Please make sure the NDA is signed before you disclose any sensitive\n\ninformation.\n\nDo not attempt to gain our competitors' confidential information when talking to colleagues from\n\ncompetitor companies. We respect our competitors and try to maintain honest competition. If you have\n\nfriends or close relatives working for a Yango competitor, please be cautious when discussing business with\n\nthem.\n\nWhen you interact with government authorities in the countries where we operate, follow the relevant\n\nrecommendations of our GR Department. You may communicate with officials on behalf of Yango only if you\n\nare authorized to do so. When communicating with officials, offer only Yango's official position. If you are\n\nnot aware of Yango's official position, redirect the issue to the GR Department. Any inquiries from theCode of Business Ethics & Conduct of\nthe Yango Group\n\n7\n\nmass media should be redirected to the PR Department.**6. Making Contracts**When making contracts on behalf of Yango, we should always try to look for the best deal and pursue\n\nYango's interests. However, while the cost of a deal is undoubtedly important, other factors such as the\n\nreputation of a potential business partner should not be underestimated.\n\nAt Yango, we have internal procedures that define who is authorized to have access to Yango's funds or sign\n\ncontracts on behalf of Yango. You can find information about the authorized signatories in our internal\n\ndocuments.\n\nWe expect all those who are authorized to sign contracts and who have access to Yango's budget to be\n\ncareful and considerate in spending our funds, and to sign contracts only after obtaining any appropriate\n\ninternal approvals. If you sign a contract, make sure you understand and agree with every condition. Each\n\ncontract must be approved in accordance with the approval procedure. Appropriate due diligence must be\n\nconducted on all vendors and contract signatories prior to Yango engaging in business with them.**7. Environmental Responsibility**We are aware of our responsibility to society to protect the environment\nand adhere to the following\n\nprinciples in our work.\n\nYango takes seriously its responsibilities regarding environmental protection, handling of hazardous\n\nmaterials, air and water emissions, and waste management.\n\nThe company strives to use energy, water, raw materials and other resources in a sustainable manner, and to\n\npay attention to climate change and energy efficiency.\n\nIt is our preference (whenever possible) to use recycled, reused and recyclable materials, and encourage\n\ncontractors to use the most environmentally friendly packaging materials.**8. Accurate Company Records****Keeping Records**As a public company, Yango is required to maintain complete and accurate\nbusiness and financial records.\n\nWe are required to record all assets, liabilities, revenues, expenses and business transactions of Yango in a\n\nmanner that is accurate, timely, and complete. Making false or misleading records or accounts or concealing\n\ninformation is strictly prohibited and will result in termination. Records and reports must be protected and\n\nstored appropriately from the moment they are received or created.**Audit**Like any other public company, Yango has both internal and external auditors responsible for monitoring our\n\nfinancial accounting and evaluating our internal control system. If you receive an enquiry from an auditor, you\n\nmust provide them with complete and accurate information free from any misrepresentation or\n\nmanipulation.**9. Complaints and Consequences of Violations****Complaint Procedure**We offer a confidential hotline, through which Yango Group employees, third parties, users, partners and\n\nclients can notify Yango of any violation of this Сode. The hotline is accessible via a special form for\n\nsubmitting reports: https:// yandex.hotline.b1.ru. The hotline is run by an independent company, and every\n\nreport is addressed to the alert investigation team. Your message will receive an identification number that\n\nyou can use to track the response of our alert investigation team or to provide further information.\n\nMessages received to the hotline are reviewed by a review panel including the members of the Company's\n\nEthics Committee.\n\nQuestions regarding the work of any Yango service may be submitted via the 'Contact us' link on the web\n\npage of each service.Code of Business Ethics & Conduct of the Yango Group\n\n8\n\nAny form of retaliation against those who, in good faith, seek help, provide information, or otherwise assist\n\nin an investigation regarding any known or suspected violations, is strictly prohibited at Yango.**Enforcement**Each company employee bears personal responsibility (ranging from\ndisciplinary to criminal) for complying\n\nwith these rules. Supervisors of violators, if they were aware of the violation but took no action, may also be\n\nsubject to disciplinary action.\n\nIssues related to non-compliance with Yango business ethics principles by Yango business partners are\n\ncovered in the Supplier Code of Conduct.**Waivers**Waivers of this Code may be considered and granted on a case-by-case basis and only in extraordinary\n\ncircumstances. Waivers may be granted or refused by Yango in its sole discretion and, if required by\n\napplicable laws, regulations, or rules, must be promptly publicly disclosed.**10. Amendments**The Ethics Committee may review this Сode as required.

Do not issue promo codes without approval outside of approved logic\n- this is prohibited. If in\n\nmessengers or social networks you were offered to \"help users\" and \"increase the earnings of drivers\"\n\nusing promo codes - do not agree. Such actions are considered fraudulent and violate the company's\n\nrules and laws. For this, you will be fired, prosecuted and asked to reimburse the material damage to\n\nthe company.\n\n20\\. Do not remove or block users on your own initiative. You can get fired for breaking the rules of the\n\nCompany.\n\n21\\. Do not disclose data outside of the company. For this, you can be fired and prosecuted. Do not\n\ntransmit data in the form of files, printouts, photocopies, or other means. Do not send screenshots to\n\nthird parties, do not share data in unprotected non-working chats. Don't stream your work or post it on\n\nYouTube or other services. Remember the main rule:**all data the ones you work with is****confidential**.\n\n22\\. If the colleagues ask you to send them data, first ask why they don't have access to it. Confidential\n\ninformation can not be passed \"just like that\". There must be a justification for this. If a colleague asks\n\nfor a screenshot, upload it to Disk, delete all personal information on the image.\n\n23\\. You can not make compensation for personal purposes. Whether you do it for yourself, colleagues,\n\nfriends, or relatives, these rules are the same for everyone. For their violation, you can be fired,\n\nprosecuted and asked to compensate for material damage to the company. Even in cases where you\n\nare entitled to compensation by logic, you can not do it yourself. This is forbidden.\n\n24\\. You can not store usernames, passwords, and login keys in messengers, social networks, and\n\nother open sources. If you do that, you will be easily hacked. Store usernames and passwords in\n\nYandex. Browser.25. Do not pass your work accesses (usernames/passwords/tokens, etc.) and equipment to anyone.\n\nEven colleagues. This is forbidden. This way you can violate the NDA and disclose commercial\n\nsecrets: for this you will be fired and assigned an administrative or criminal punishment.\n\n26\\. Do not pass data about yourself and your colleagues to clients for communication outside of logic.\n\n27\\. Do not upload work problem guides (logics and instructions) to file sharing sites and third-party\n\nresources. They contain descriptions of our internal logic and screenshots of tools: publishing such\n\nmaterials outside the Company is considered a violation of the NDA. For this, you can be fired and\n\nprosecuted. Create manuals only on Wiki pages or add and update existing manuals.\n\n28\\. Don't use tools to bypass working logic, even if you want to achieve high performance. Example:\n\nwhen instead of dealing with customers ' problems, you just automatically give them promo codes. You\n\ncan't do that.\n\n29\\. Do not communicate with customers by their personal numbers and do not write to them with\n\ncomplaints, threats and insults. You might get fired for that. Even when the client is rude to you and you\n\nreally want to write him something mean in response - please restrain yourself. Unfortunately, such\n\nsituations are the specifics of your work and you need to be able to cope with them. If the client has\n\nspoiled your mood, discuss it with the Manager: he will suggest practices that will help reduce stress.\n\n30\\. You can not transfer to someone or sell equipment and devices that you take in office vending\n\nmachine or order yourself through the Helpy support service. For every such thing, you yourself are\n\nfinancially responsible --- do not forget about it. Use equipment and devices from Yango only for work.\n\n31\\. The employee is required to ensure access to internet connectivity necessary for work purposes. In\n\nthe event that the employee does not have access to Internet at home, it is expected that they make\n\nnecessary arrangements to utilize other (at least -- office) internet facilities.

What could be done here? |  |\nSo far, we set a limit based on the average cost of meals. We'll collect the feedback and data during 2025 and depending on outcomes, might\nconsider reviewing the limits in 2026.\n\n| ##### |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| Will be any tax deducted from the salary for this reimbursement? |  |\nSince meal benefit constitutes additional income from a tax point of view, the relevant payroll tax amounts will be deducted from the\npayment.\n\n| ##### Is it possible to use the limit on business trips? |  |\n| --- | --- |\nThe meal benefit limit only works in the country in which you are employed.\n\n| ##### Can I get compensation if I work from home? |  |\n| --- | --- |\nYou can use the limit only on those days when you work from the office.\n\n| ##### What happens if my order costs more than the daily limit? |  |\n| --- | --- |\nIf you exceed the limit, the excess amount will not be compensated. If, however, the limit is not fully used up, its balance will not be\ncompensated and will not be carried over to the next days. For example, if the order amount is 20 AZN, only 15 AZN will be compensated, and the\nremaining 5 AZN will be at your expense. If the daily order cost is 10 AZN, then only 10 AZN will be compensated.

Их выдают лично в руки, потому что в них есть персональные данные.\n\nНа подготовку нестандартной справки, например, по собственному шаблону или с произвольным текстом, может потребоваться больше 5 дней.\n\n#### Как получить справку\n\nЗаполнить заявку на справку можно в [Helpy](https://helpy.yandex-team.ru/services?form=594&search=)\n\n# Отпуск\n\n### Основной отпуск и его продолжительность\n\nОплачиваемый отпуск предоставляется сотруднику ежегодно. У не специалистов оплачиваемый основной отпуск --- не менее 21 календарного\nдня, а у специалистов и руководителей  --- 30 календарных дней.\n\nУйти в отпуск официально можно спустя полгода работы в Яндексе, но если руководитель не против, можно пойти и раньше. Отпуск за второй и\nпоследующие годы работы можно взять в любое время, это нужно согласовать с руководителем.\n\nВ конце рабочего года сотрудник вправе получить денежную компенсацию за неиспользованные отпускные дни.\n\nЕсли во время отпуска есть праздничные нерабочие дни, то они не включаются в календарные дни отпуска и не оплачиваются.\n\nНепрерывный отпуск\n\nВ Трудовом кодексе Азербайджана сказано, что каждый трудовой год нужно ходить в отпуск таким образом, чтобы хотя бы одна из частей отпуска\nдлилась 14 дней подряд (включая выходные).\n\nВажно! Праздничные дни не входят в число дней отпуска. Если в ваш отмеченный 14-дневный отпуск попали праздничные дни, нужно добавить к\nотпуску ещё два дня, чтобы общее количество дней, кроме праздничных, получилось 14.\n\nОставшийся запас дней отпуска, по согласованию с вашим непосредственным руководителем, как и раньше, можно поделить на сколько угодно частей\nлюбой продолжительности.\n\nЕсли у вас накопится 14 или больше дней отпуска, то в планировщике отсутствий автоматически добавится двухнедельный непрерывный отпуск. Мы\nотметим его голубой ленточкой с замочком.\n\nОтменить или сократить отпуск с замочком не получится, а если вы подвинете его на период, куда попадают праздники, вам будет\nавтоматически предложено увеличить его на количество праздничных дней (именно праздничных, т.к. выходные дни включаются в период отпуска).\n\n### На сколько и когда даётся дополнительный отпуск за стаж работы\n\nВ зависимости от стажа работы работникам предоставляется дополнительный отпуск:\n- При стаже работы от 5 до 10 лет --- 2 календарных дня;\n- При стаже работы от 10 до 15 лет --- 4 календарных дня;\n- При стаже работы более 15 лет --- 6 календарных дней.\n\n### Дополнительные отпуска женщинам, имеющим детей\n\nНезависимо от продолжительности основного и дополнительного отпусков женщинам, имеющим двух детей до 14 лет, предоставляется дополнительный\nотпуск 2 дня. Если у женщины 3 и более детей этого возраста, или есть ребёнок с ограниченными возможностями здоровья --- к отпуску добавляется\n5 календарных дней.\n\nПраво на отпуск есть весь год, в который одному из детей исполняется 14 лет.\n\n### Продолжительность отпусков работников с инвалидностью\n\nУ работников в возрасте до 16 лет трудовой отпуск предоставляется не менее, чем на 42 календарных дня. А работникам от 16 до 18 лет --- не\nменее 35 дней.\n\nСовершеннолетним независимо от группы, причины и сроков инвалидности трудовой отпуск предоставляется не менее, чем на 42 календарных дня.\n\n### Продолжительность трудового отпуска работников, имеющих особые заслуги перед азербайджанским народом\n\nРаботникам, получившим увечье (ранение, травму, контузию) во имя свободы, суверенитета и территориальной целостности Азербайджана,\nНациональным героям Азербайджана, награждённым орденом независимости, а также другими государственными наградами в связи с защитой\nсуверенитета и территориальной целостности Азербайджана, предоставляется отпуск не менее 46 календарных дней.\n\n### Оплачиваемые учебные отпуска\n\nСтудентам предоставляются оплачиваемые учебные отпуска:\n\nа) Для участия в сессиях, выполнения лабораторных работ, сдачи зачётов и экзаменов;\n\nб) Для сдачи госэкзаменов;\n\nв) Для подготовки и защиты дипломного проекта (работы).\n\n### Отпуска по беременности и родам\n\nВ период беременности и послеродовой период работающим женщинам предоставляется оплачиваемый отпуск продолжительностью 126 календарных\nдней: 70 календарных дней до родов и 56 дней после. При тяжелых родах, при рождении двух и более детей послеродовой отпуск увеличивается до 70\nкалендарных дней.\n\nПодробнее можно прочитать в разделе [Декрет](https://wiki.yandex-team.ru/hr/hr-azerbaijan/#nav10).\n\n### Кто может взять частично оплачиваемый социальный отпуск и как его использовать\n\nОдин из родителей или другой член семьи, который ухаживает за ребёнком до достижения им возраста 3 лет, имеет право пользоваться частично\nоплачиваемым социальным отпуском по уходу за ребенком с выдачей пособия. Размер пособия определяется законодательством.\n\nЧтобы получить такой отпуск, нужно написать заявление на полное или частичное его использование.\n\n### Виды неоплачиваемых отпусков\n\nРаботник может взять неоплачиваемый отпуск, обговорив его с руководителем. Его продолжительность можно обсуждать, но он не должен\nбыть больше 6 месяцев.\n\nКогда и на сколько можно взять неоплачиваемый отпуск:\n- По заключению врачебно-консультационной комиссии одному из родителей\n  ребёнка с хроническим заболеванием, или другому члену семьи, который ухаживает за ребёнком --- до того, как ребёнок достигнет 4 лет;\n- Мужьям, жёны которых находятся в отпуске из-за родов --- 14\n  календарных дней; Женщинам или одиноким родителям, попечителям, опекунам, имеющим ребёнка до 16 лет --- до 14 календарных дней;\n- Независимо от группы и причин сотрудникам (до 18 лет и взрослым)\n  с инвалидностью --- до одного календарного месяца;\n- Сотрудникам, которые участвовали в войне в составе действующей армии\n  Азербайджана --- до 14 календарных дней;\n- Работникам, получившим увечье (ранение, травму, контузию) при защите\n  территориальной целостности и суверенитета Азербайджана --- до 14 календарных дней;\n- Родителям детей с ВИЧ, а также имеющим детей до 18 лет\n  с инвалидностью --- до 14 календарных дней;\n- Работникам, обучающимся в аспирантуре, докторантуре --- до одного\n  календарного месяца;\n- Работникам, допущенным к приёмным экзаменам в вузы --- 14 календарных\n  дней, а работникам, допущенным к приёмным экзаменам в средние специальные учебные заведения --- 7 календарных дней;\n- Авторам изобретения или рационализаторского предложения, которое\n  впервые внедряется за пределами предприятия, где он работает --- до 14 календарных дней;\n- Одному из родственников, который ухаживает за больным членом семьи\n  по заключению врача --- до 14 календарных дней;\n- Работникам с детьми с инвалидностью до 18 лет --- до 14 календарных\n  дней;\n- По семейным, бытовым и другим личным причинам --- до 7 календарных\n  дней.\n\n### Отпуск донорам\n- Донору полагается два дня отдыха: в день сдачи крови и любой другой\nдень. Чтобы взять отпуск в день сдачи, нужно согласовать отсутствие с руководителем и создать тикет в очереди VACATION за 5 дней. После сдачи\nкрови следует приложить в тикет для оформления отсутствия справку из донорского центра и предоставить в отдел кадров.\n- Дополнительный день отдыха по желанию донора может быть присоединен\nк ежегодному отпуску или использован в другое удобное время в течение года. Чтобы взять дополнительный день отдыха, нужно согласовать\nотсутствие с руководителем и создать тикет в очереди VACATION за 5 дней и указать день сдачи крови.\n\n### Как оформить отпуск\n1. [В планировщике отсутствий на\nСтаффе](https://staff.yandex-team.ru/gap) (<https://staff.yandex-team.ru/gap/>) отметьте дни, когда вас не будет на рабочем месте.\n\n2\\. Автоматически сформируется тикет в очереди VACATION.\n\n3\\. Руководитель должен подтвердить ваш отпуск в тикете или планировщике отсутствий на Стаффе (<https://staff.yandex-team.ru/gap/>)\n\n4\\. Предоставить заявление об отпуске в отдел кадров.\n\nЗапрашивайте отпуск за 14 дней до его начала.\n\n### Баланс отпускных дней\n\nБаланс отпускных дней обновляется ежемесячно и отображает количество дней на текущий месяц на СТАФФ.\n\n# Декрет\n\n#### Отпуска по беременности и родам\n\nВ период беременности и послеродовой период работающим женщинам предоставляется оплачиваемый отпуск продолжительностью 126 календарных\nдней (до родов 70 календарных дней и после родов 56 календарных дней). При тяжелых родах, при рождении двух и более детей послеродовой отпуск\nпредоставляется продолжительностью 70 календарных дней.\n\nЖенщинам, работающим в сельскохозяйственном производстве, отпуска по беременности и родам предоставляются следующей продолжительностью:\\\nа) при нормальных родах 140 календарных дней (до родов 70 календарных дней и после родов 70 календарных дней);\\\nб) при тяжелых родах 156 календарных дней (до родов 70 календарных дней и после родов 86 календарных дней);\\\nв) при рождении двух и более детей 180 календарных дней (до родов 70 календарных дней и после родов 110 календарных дней).\n\n#### Право на частично оплачиваемый социальный отпуск и порядок его использования\n\nОдин из родителей, или другой член семьи, непосредственно ухаживающий за ребенком до достижения им возраста 3 лет, имеют право пользоваться\nчастично оплачиваемым социальным отпуском по уходу за ребенком с выдачей пособия в размере, определенном законодательством.\n\nРаботник, ухаживающий за ребенком, на основании письменного заявления может использовать право на частично оплачиваемый социальный отпуск\nполностью или частями.\n\n#### Привилегии сотрудницам\n\nУ беременных женщин и женщин, имеющих ребенка до полутора лет еженедельные рабочие часы не должны превышать 36 часов (при кормлении 32\nчаса). Для оформления сокращенного рабочего времени, необходимо предоставить мед.справку в отдел кадров.\n\nЖенщинам с детьми до 14 лет необходимо написать заявление о согласии работать в праздничный день и в ночную смену.\n\n# Больничный\n\n### Что делать, если вы заболели\n\n1\\. Сообщите об этом своему руководителю.\n\n2\\. Обязательно отметьте [на Стаффе в планировщике отсутствий](https://staff.yandex-team.ru/gap) период вашей болезни или\nпопросите это сделать вашего руководителя.\n\n3\\. Обратитесь к врачу в поликлинику или вызовите его на дом, чтобы оформить больничный лист.\n\n4\\. После выздоровления не забудьте закрыть больничный у врача --- он не действителен без печати и подписи врача. В день выхода на работу\nотправьте скан своего больничного листа в тикет, а оригинал предоставьте в отдел кадров.\n\n### Как оплачивается больничный\n\nПособие по временной нетрудоспособности за первые 14 дней выплачивается за счёт работодателя, а за оставшиеся дни --- за счёт взносов\nпо обязательному государственному соцстрахованию. Пособие выплачивается с первого до последнего дня болезни.\n\nПособие не назначается в этих случаях:\n- Страховой стаж работника менее 6 месяцев;\n- Нет взносов социального страхования на текущей работе;\n- Работник умышленно навредил своему здоровью или соврал о болезни,\nчтобы уклониться от работы;\n- Временная нетрудоспособность наступила из-за преступления, которое\nсовершил работник;\n- Работник проходит принудительное лечение по решению суда (кроме\nлюдей с особенностями психического развития).\n\nПособие по временной нетрудоспособности вычисляется из зарплаты, включающей оклад, надбавки и премии.\n\nРазмер пособия рассчитывается по формуле. Для этого берётся сумма заработка за последние 12 месяцев до выхода на больничный и делится на\nколичество рабочих дней за этот период.\n\nНапример:\n\nАлекпер вышел на больничный в январе 2023 года. Его социальный стаж --- 9 лет. За предыдущие 12 месяцев он заработал в общем 12 000 манат и\nотработал 230 дней. Чтобы определить, сколько он получит за день больничного, считаем: 12 000 : 230 = 52 манат. Соответственно, если\nАлекпер будет на больничном 7 дней, пособие составит 52 * 7 = 364 манат\n- 0.8 = 291.2 манат.\n\nЕсли сотрудник не работал в течение последних 12 полных месяцев до больничного, то средний дневной заработок за один рабочий день\nопределяется иначе. Для этого минимальную месячную зарплату (МРОТ) делим на количество рабочих дней в месяце, когда работник ушёл на больничный.\n\nНапример:\n\nПоследние 12 месяцев Алия была в декрете. Только вышла на работу в апреле и приболела. Её социальный стаж --- 5 лет.Так как зарплата\nв предыдущие 12 месяцев не начислялась, мы берём минимальную месячную зарплату (МРОТ)  и делим на количество рабочих дней в апреле: 345 манат:\n20 = 17,25 манат. Соответственно, если Алия будет на больничном 7 дней, пособие составит 120,75 манат * 0,6 = 72,45 манат.\n\nВ целом размер пособия по временной нетрудоспособности зависит от социального стажа работника:\n- 100% заработка -- более 12 лет стажа;\n- 80% заработка -- 8-12 лет стажа;\n- 60% заработка -- до 8 лет стажа.\n\n# Увольнения\n\n#### Как устроен процесс увольнения\n\n1\\. Если вы покидаете компанию по собственному желанию, пожалуйста, необходимо оповестить непосредственного руководителя и создать тикет в\nочереди [INQUIT](https://st.yandex-team.ru/createTicket?queue=INTQUIT&_form=66687ade40e3616bc95929e9). Информацию о предстоящем увольнении**нужно направить за месяц до даты\nухода из компании**.\n\n2\\. В последний рабочий день нужно вернуть всё оборудование, пропуск, корпоративную сим-карту и полис  ДМС.\n\n3\\. В день увольнения нужно приехать в офис, чтобы подписать документы и забрать трудовую книжку.\n\nВсе дополнительные вопросы обсуждаются непосредственно с руководителем.\n\n# Заработная плата\n\n#### Как и куда выплачивается зарплата\n\nЗарплата выплачивается сотрудникам ежемесячно в последний рабочий день месяца. Деньги перечисляются на зарплатную карту сотрудника. Каждый\nсотрудник вправе запросить расчётный листок с детализацией по выплате у бухгалтерии.\n\nЕсли возникнут вопросы касательно зарплаты, необходимо создать тикет в очереди [PAYROLL](https://st.yandex-team.ru/createTicket?queue=PAYROLL&_form=false).\n\n#### Аванс\n\nАванс выдаётся сотрудникам, которые прошли испытательный срок. Его можно получить 1 раз в 3 месяца. Для этого нужно написать заявление об авансе\nдо 15 числа месяца.\n\nВыплата не может быть больше 50% от месячной зарплаты или включать в себя всю сумму, заработанную за половину месяца.\n\nРасчёт заработной платы: [Gross-Net и Net-Gross](https://jing.yandex-team.ru/files/kukuruza/Salary_calculation%28Azerbaijan%29.xlsx).\n\n# Налоги и льготы\n\n#### Подоходный налог\n\nСумма, подлежащая налогообложению до 8000 манат: 0%: 0%\n\nЕсли сумма подлежащая налогообложению превышает 8000: (сумма подлежащая налогообложению -8000 -- * 14%)\n\n#### Распределения в ГФСЗ\n\nЕсли зарплата до 200 Azn: начисленная месячная зарплата *3%\n\nЕсли заработная плата выше 200 Azn: 6 Azn+(начисленная месячная заработная плата-200 Azn) *10%\n\n#### Страховые вычисления по безработице\n\nНачисленная месячная зарплата * 0.5%\n\n#### Плата за обязательное медицинское страхование:\n\nНачисленная месячная зарплата * 2%\n\nИтоговая выплачивая сумма(NET):\n\nНачисленная зарплата(GROSS) - Подоходный налог - Распределения в ФСЗН - Страховые вычисления по безработице - Плата за обязательное медицинское\nстрахование.\n\n# Командировки\n\nПодробно о командировках можно почитать [на Вики.](https://wiki.yandex-team.ru/hr/travel-all/oformlenie-komandirovok-mezhdunarodnyx-ofisov/)\n\n#### Проезд на такси\n\nКомпания компенсирует расходы на такси для проезда:\n- В аэропорт и обратно;\n- К автостанции, ж/д вокзалу или другому месту отправления (если нет\nдругих видов транспорта и поездку утвердил руководитель).\n\nПоездки на такси по городу, в том числе из гостиницы в офис и обратно\n- не оплачиваются.\n\nЧтобы получить компенсацию, нужно получить документы с подтверждением оплаты такси, например чек из приложения или фискальный чек. Пожалуйста,\nне теряйте их --- иначе придётся оплачивать поездку самостоятельно.Отчёт о поездке и фискальный чек нужно прислать [через\nтикет.](https://wiki.yandex-team.ru/expense-reports-via-expensify/)\n\n#### Срок командировки\n\nСрок командировки определяется по датам в билетах. Чтобы её продлить, нужно отписаться в тикете и согласовать это с руководителем.\n\nВ течение трёх дней после окончания командировки нужно переслать в тикете о командировке сканы посадочных талонов, чеки и другие\nподтверждающие документы.\n\nВажно, чтобы все документы были оформлены верно, а чеки сохранились --- иначе командировочные расходы не возместят.\n\n#### Суточные\n\nСуточные выплачиваются за все дни командировки, кроме тех, которые сотрудник добавил к командировке, чтобы заняться личными делами\nв городе.\n\nРазмер суточных определяется [по решению и распоряжению кабинета министров\nАзербайджана.](https://h.yandex-team.ru/?https://www.taxes.gov.az/az/post/714) Но по запросу руководителя их можно увеличить.\n\n# Изменение персональных данных\n\n#### Как изменить персональные данные\n\nЕсли хотите изменить какие-то персональные данные, заполните и отправьте эту форму.

It is a\n   284\tmultidisciplinary field that focuses on managing and ensuring the well-being of individuals and the protection of the environment within\n   285\tvarious settings, including workplaces, communities, and public spaces. EHS encompasses a wide range of practices, policies, and regulations\n   286\tthat aim to prevent accidents, injuries, and illnesses while minimizing the negative impact on the environment.\n   287\t\n   288\tThe primary objectives of EHS are to create safe and healthy working conditions, promote sustainable practices, and comply with legal\n   289\trequirements to safeguard both employees and the surrounding environment. By integrating these three essential components --\n   290\tEnvironment, Health, and Safety -- organizations can proactively identify and mitigate potential hazards, reduce risks, and enhance\n   291\toverall performance.\n   292\t\n   293\tKey aspects of EHS include:\n   294\t1. Environment: This aspect addresses the impact of human activities on\n   295\t    the natural world. It involves assessing and managing issues such as air and water quality, waste management, energy efficiency, and the\n   296\t    conservation of natural resources. By implementing environmentally responsible practices, organizations can contribute to a greener and\n   297\t    more sustainable future.\n   298\t2. Health: EHS aims to protect the health and well-being of\n   299\t    individuals, whether they are employees, customers, or residents of nearby communities. This involves identifying workplace hazards,\n   300\t    promoting healthy behaviors, providing proper training, and offering access to medical services to prevent and address illnesses and\n   301\t    injuries.\n   302\t3. Safety: Safety is a fundamental aspect of EHS, focusing on\n   303\t    preventing accidents and injuries in various settings. Workplace safety measures can include ergonomic assessments, machine guarding,\n   304\t    safety training, and emergency preparedness to ensure the physical well-being of employees and visitors.\n   305\t\n   306\tAdopting a robust EHS program not only helps organizations maintain a positive reputation but also enhances productivity and efficiency by\n   307\treducing downtime due to accidents or environmental incidents. Additionally, it demonstrates a commitment to social responsibility and\n   308\tsustainability, which is increasingly important in today's world.\n   309\t\n   310\tOverall, EHS plays a vital role in maintaining a healthy workforce, protecting the environment, and contributing to the long-term success\n   311\tand resilience of businesses and communities alike.**Courses**[**Course health safety at work in English**](https://quantum.yandex-team.ru/courses/HESAWORK19)\n   312\t\n   313\t[**Course health safety at work in Georgian**](https://quantum.yandex-team.ru/courses/HSEWORK19_GE)\n   314\t\n   315\t[**Course health safety at work in Armenian**](https://quantum.yandex-team.ru/courses/HSEWORK19_HY)\n   316\t\n   317\t[**Course health safety at work in Spanish**](https://quantum.yandex-team.ru/courses/HSEWORK19_ES)\n   318\t\n   319\t[**Course health safety at work in Azerbaijani**](https://quantum.yandex-team.ru/courses/HSEWORK19_AZ)\n   320\t\n   321\t[**Course health safety at work in Turkish**](https://quantum.yandex-team.ru/courses/HSEWORK19_TR)\n   322\t\n   323\t[**Course health safety at work in French**](https://quantum.yandex-team.ru/courses/HSEWORK19_FR)\n   324\t\n   325\t[**Course health safety at work in Arabian**](https://quantum.yandex-team.ru/courses/HSEWORK19_AR)\n   326\t\n   327\t[**Covid-19 info course**](https://quantum.yandex-team.ru/courses/010203)**Risk reduction**Assessment of professional risks\n   328\t\n   329\tIdentification of hazards: identify potential hazards in the office, including ergonomic issues, electrical malfunctions, and chemical\n   330\texposures (detecting all risks related to equipment, environment, or processes).\n   331\t\n   332\tRisk Evaluation: analyzing the likelihood and severity of harm from each hazard - use checklists, inspections, and incident reports to assess\n   333\trisks (Tickets system in Yango).\n   334\t\n   335\tRisk reduction measures: developing strategies to minimize risks, such as safety protocols, training, and protective measures as well as\n   336\timplement engineering controls, administrative policies, and personal protective equipment to mitigate identified risks.\n   337\t\n   338\tRisks hunting\n   339\t\n   340\tReporting safety concerns is crucial for maintaining a secure workplace.

It is a\nmultidisciplinary field that focuses on managing and ensuring the well-being of individuals and the protection of the environment within\nvarious settings, including workplaces, communities, and public spaces. EHS encompasses a wide range of practices, policies, and regulations\nthat aim to prevent accidents, injuries, and illnesses while minimizing the negative impact on the environment.\n\nThe primary objectives of EHS are to create safe and healthy working conditions, promote sustainable practices, and comply with legal\nrequirements to safeguard both employees and the surrounding environment. By integrating these three essential components --\nEnvironment, Health, and Safety -- organizations can proactively identify and mitigate potential hazards, reduce risks, and enhance\noverall performance.\n\nKey aspects of EHS include:\n1. Environment: This aspect addresses the impact of human activities on\n    the natural world. It involves assessing and managing issues such as air and water quality, waste management, energy efficiency, and the\n    conservation of natural resources. By implementing environmentally responsible practices, organizations can contribute to a greener and\n    more sustainable future.\n2. Health: EHS aims to protect the health and well-being of\n    individuals, whether they are employees, customers, or residents of nearby communities. This involves identifying workplace hazards,\n    promoting healthy behaviors, providing proper training, and offering access to medical services to prevent and address illnesses and\n    injuries.\n3. Safety: Safety is a fundamental aspect of EHS, focusing on\n    preventing accidents and injuries in various settings. Workplace safety measures can include ergonomic assessments, machine guarding,\n    safety training, and emergency preparedness to ensure the physical well-being of employees and visitors.\n\nAdopting a robust EHS program not only helps organizations maintain a positive reputation but also enhances productivity and efficiency by\nreducing downtime due to accidents or environmental incidents. Additionally, it demonstrates a commitment to social responsibility and\nsustainability, which is increasingly important in today's world.\n\nOverall, EHS plays a vital role in maintaining a healthy workforce, protecting the environment, and contributing to the long-term success\nand resilience of businesses and communities alike.**Courses**[**Course health safety at work in English**](https://quantum.yandex-team.ru/courses/HESAWORK19)\n\n[**Course health safety at work in Georgian**](https://quantum.yandex-team.ru/courses/HSEWORK19_GE)\n\n[**Course health safety at work in Armenian**](https://quantum.yandex-team.ru/courses/HSEWORK19_HY)\n\n[**Course health safety at work in Spanish**](https://quantum.yandex-team.ru/courses/HSEWORK19_ES)\n\n[**Course health safety at work in Azerbaijani**](https://quantum.yandex-team.ru/courses/HSEWORK19_AZ)\n\n[**Course health safety at work in Turkish**](https://quantum.yandex-team.ru/courses/HSEWORK19_TR)\n\n[**Course health safety at work in French**](https://quantum.yandex-team.ru/courses/HSEWORK19_FR)\n\n[**Course health safety at work in Arabian**](https://quantum.yandex-team.ru/courses/HSEWORK19_AR)\n\n[**Covid-19 info course**](https://quantum.yandex-team.ru/courses/010203)**Risk reduction**Assessment of professional risks\n\nIdentification of hazards: identify potential hazards in the office, including ergonomic issues, electrical malfunctions, and chemical\nexposures (detecting all risks related to equipment, environment, or processes).\n\nRisk Evaluation: analyzing the likelihood and severity of harm from each hazard - use checklists, inspections, and incident reports to assess\nrisks (Tickets system in Yango).\n\nRisk reduction measures: developing strategies to minimize risks, such as safety protocols, training, and protective measures as well as\nimplement engineering controls, administrative policies, and personal protective equipment to mitigate identified risks.\n\nRisks hunting\n\nReporting safety concerns is crucial for maintaining a secure workplace. Employees can promptly identify and report hazards through the HSE\nreporting form:\n\n[  HSE risks hunting (en)](https://forms.yandex-team.ru/ext/surveys/13704655/)\n\nThis proactive approach helps the HSE team investigate and implement corrective actions, preventing future incidents. Open communication\nfosters a culture of safety and ensures timely resolution of issues, protecting everyone in the workplace.\n\nNear Miss\n\nNear miss is an unplanned event that didn't result in injury, illness or damage -- but had the potential to do so.\n\nHazard communication\n\nHazard communication ensures that employees are informed about potential risks in the workplace. Open communication channels allow employees to\nreport and address hazards promptly.\n\nBy promoting transparency and awareness, hazard communication helps prevent accidents and fosters a safer work environment where everyone\nunderstands and complies with safety protocols.\n\nInformation about risks\n\nEmployees receive timely information about risks through:\n- Security guides\n- Meetings and trainings\n- Information materials in public places\n- Wiki pages\n- Safety signs\n- Briefings\n- Documents, tickets and feedback\n- Registers with employee signatures\n- Feedback channels\n\nYango has internally established protocols for quickly informing employees about risks and dangers. In addition, in each country we\norganize internal emergency services from volunteers for timely monitoring and management of emergency situations, evacuations and first\naid.\n\nPlease report near miss directly via hse@yango.com**Contacts**If you have any questions, concerns, or suggestions regarding health, safety, or environmental issues, please don't hesitate to reach out to\nthe HSE team.**[Вера Коншина](https://staff.yandex-team.ru/verakonshina) - Head of HSE department**\\**[Мария Валиева](https://staff.yandex-team.ru/valievamv) - HSE\nspecialist**We are here to support you, address your concerns, and help ensure a safe and healthy working environment for everyone.\n\nYour feedback and observations are invaluable in maintaining a culture of safety and continuous improvement.

It is a\n   186\tmultidisciplinary field that focuses on managing and ensuring the well-being of individuals and the protection of the environment within\n   187\tvarious settings, including workplaces, communities, and public spaces. EHS encompasses a wide range of practices, policies, and regulations\n   188\tthat aim to prevent accidents, injuries, and illnesses while minimizing the negative impact on the environment.\n   189\t\n   190\tThe primary objectives of EHS are to create safe and healthy working conditions, promote sustainable practices, and comply with legal\n   191\trequirements to safeguard both employees and the surrounding environment. By integrating these three essential components --\n   192\tEnvironment, Health, and Safety -- organizations can proactively identify and mitigate potential hazards, reduce risks, and enhance\n   193\toverall performance.\n   194\t\n   195\tKey aspects of EHS include:\n   196\t1. Environment: This aspect addresses the impact of human activities on\n   197\t    the natural world. It involves assessing and managing issues such as air and water quality, waste management, energy efficiency, and the\n   198\t    conservation of natural resources. By implementing environmentally responsible practices, organizations can contribute to a greener and\n   199\t    more sustainable future.\n   200\t2. Health: EHS aims to protect the health and well-being of\n   201\t    individuals, whether they are employees, customers, or residents of nearby communities. This involves identifying workplace hazards,\n   202\t    promoting healthy behaviors, providing proper training, and offering access to medical services to prevent and address illnesses and\n   203\t    injuries.\n   204\t3. Safety: Safety is a fundamental aspect of EHS, focusing on\n   205\t    preventing accidents and injuries in various settings. Workplace safety measures can include ergonomic assessments, machine guarding,\n   206\t    safety training, and emergency preparedness to ensure the physical well-being of employees and visitors.\n   207\t\n   208\tAdopting a robust EHS program not only helps organizations maintain a positive reputation but also enhances productivity and efficiency by\n   209\treducing downtime due to accidents or environmental incidents. Additionally, it demonstrates a commitment to social responsibility and\n   210\tsustainability, which is increasingly important in today's world.\n   211\t\n   212\tOverall, EHS plays a vital role in maintaining a healthy workforce, protecting the environment, and contributing to the long-term success\n   213\tand resilience of businesses and communities alike.**Courses**[**Course health safety at work in English**](https://quantum.yandex-team.ru/courses/HESAWORK19)\n   214\t\n   215\t[**Course health safety at work in Georgian**](https://quantum.yandex-team.ru/courses/HSEWORK19_GE)\n   216\t\n   217\t[**Course health safety at work in Armenian**](https://quantum.yandex-team.ru/courses/HSEWORK19_HY)\n   218\t\n   219\t[**Course health safety at work in Spanish**](https://quantum.yandex-team.ru/courses/HSEWORK19_ES)\n   220\t\n   221\t[**Course health safety at work in Azerbaijani**](https://quantum.yandex-team.ru/courses/HSEWORK19_AZ)\n   222\t\n   223\t[**Course health safety at work in Turkish**](https://quantum.yandex-team.ru/courses/HSEWORK19_TR)\n   224\t\n   225\t[**Course health safety at work in French**](https://quantum.yandex-team.ru/courses/HSEWORK19_FR)\n   226\t\n   227\t[**Course health safety at work in Arabian**](https://quantum.yandex-team.ru/courses/HSEWORK19_AR)\n   228\t\n   229\t[**Covid-19 info course**](https://quantum.yandex-team.ru/courses/010203)**Risk reduction**Assessment of professional risks\n   230\t\n   231\tIdentification of hazards: identify potential hazards in the office, including ergonomic issues, electrical malfunctions, and chemical\n   232\texposures (detecting all risks related to equipment, environment, or processes).\n   233\t\n   234\tRisk Evaluation: analyzing the likelihood and severity of harm from each hazard - use checklists, inspections, and incident reports to assess\n   235\trisks (Tickets system in Yango).\n   236\t\n   237\tRisk reduction measures: developing strategies to minimize risks, such as safety protocols, training, and protective measures as well as\n   238\timplement engineering controls, administrative policies, and personal protective equipment to mitigate identified risks.\n   239\t\n   240\tRisks hunting\n   241\t\n   242\tReporting safety concerns is crucial for maintaining a secure workplace.

It is a\nmultidisciplinary field that focuses on managing and ensuring the well-being of individuals and the protection of the environment within\nvarious settings, including workplaces, communities, and public spaces. EHS encompasses a wide range of practices, policies, and regulations\nthat aim to prevent accidents, injuries, and illnesses while minimizing the negative impact on the environment.\n\nThe primary objectives of EHS are to create safe and healthy working conditions, promote sustainable practices, and comply with legal\nrequirements to safeguard both employees and the surrounding environment. By integrating these three essential components --\nEnvironment, Health, and Safety -- organizations can proactively identify and mitigate potential hazards, reduce risks, and enhance\noverall performance.\n\nKey aspects of EHS include:\n1. Environment: This aspect addresses the impact of human activities on\n    the natural world. It involves assessing and managing issues such as air and water quality, waste management, energy efficiency, and the\n    conservation of natural resources. By implementing environmentally responsible practices, organizations can contribute to a greener and\n    more sustainable future.\n2. Health: EHS aims to protect the health and well-being of\n    individuals, whether they are employees, customers, or residents of nearby communities. This involves identifying workplace hazards,\n    promoting healthy behaviors, providing proper training, and offering access to medical services to prevent and address illnesses and\n    injuries.\n3. Safety: Safety is a fundamental aspect of EHS, focusing on\n    preventing accidents and injuries in various settings. Workplace safety measures can include ergonomic assessments, machine guarding,\n    safety training, and emergency preparedness to ensure the physical well-being of employees and visitors.\n\nAdopting a robust EHS program not only helps organizations maintain a positive reputation but also enhances productivity and efficiency by\nreducing downtime due to accidents or environmental incidents. Additionally, it demonstrates a commitment to social responsibility and\nsustainability, which is increasingly important in today's world.\n\nOverall, EHS plays a vital role in maintaining a healthy workforce, protecting the environment, and contributing to the long-term success\nand resilience of businesses and communities alike.**Courses**[**Course health safety at work in English**](https://quantum.yandex-team.ru/courses/HESAWORK19)\n\n[**Course health safety at work in Georgian**](https://quantum.yandex-team.ru/courses/HSEWORK19_GE)\n\n[**Course health safety at work in Armenian**](https://quantum.yandex-team.ru/courses/HSEWORK19_HY)\n\n[**Course health safety at work in Spanish**](https://quantum.yandex-team.ru/courses/HSEWORK19_ES)\n\n[**Course health safety at work in Azerbaijani**](https://quantum.yandex-team.ru/courses/HSEWORK19_AZ)\n\n[**Course health safety at work in Turkish**](https://quantum.yandex-team.ru/courses/HSEWORK19_TR)\n\n[**Course health safety at work in French**](https://quantum.yandex-team.ru/courses/HSEWORK19_FR)\n\n[**Course health safety at work in Arabian**](https://quantum.yandex-team.ru/courses/HSEWORK19_AR)\n\n[**Covid-19 info course**](https://quantum.yandex-team.ru/courses/010203)**Risk reduction**Assessment of professional risks\n\nIdentification of hazards: identify potential hazards in the office, including ergonomic issues, electrical malfunctions, and chemical\nexposures (detecting all risks related to equipment, environment, or processes).\n\nRisk Evaluation: analyzing the likelihood and severity of harm from each hazard - use checklists, inspections, and incident reports to assess\nrisks (Tickets system in Yango).\n\nRisk reduction measures: developing strategies to minimize risks, such as safety protocols, training, and protective measures as well as\nimplement engineering controls, administrative policies, and personal protective equipment to mitigate identified risks.\n\nRisks hunting\n\nReporting safety concerns is crucial for maintaining a secure workplace. Employees can promptly identify and report hazards through the HSE\nreporting form:\n\n[  HSE risks hunting (en)](https://forms.yandex-team.ru/ext/surveys/13704655/)\n\nThis proactive approach helps the HSE team investigate and implement corrective actions, preventing future incidents. Open communication\nfosters a culture of safety and ensures timely resolution of issues, protecting everyone in the workplace.\n\nNear Miss\n\nNear miss is an unplanned event that didn't result in injury, illness or damage -- but had the potential to do so.\n\nHazard communication\n\nHazard communication ensures that employees are informed about potential risks in the workplace. Open communication channels allow employees to\nreport and address hazards promptly.\n\nBy promoting transparency and awareness, hazard communication helps prevent accidents and fosters a safer work environment where everyone\nunderstands and complies with safety protocols.\n\nInformation about risks\n\nEmployees receive timely information about risks through:\n- Security guides\n- Meetings and trainings\n- Information materials in public places\n- Wiki pages\n- Safety signs\n- Briefings\n- Documents, tickets and feedback\n- Registers with employee signatures\n- Feedback channels\n\nYango has internally established protocols for quickly informing employees about risks and dangers. In addition, in each country we\norganize internal emergency services from volunteers for timely monitoring and management of emergency situations, evacuations and first\naid.\n\nPlease report near miss directly via hse@yango.com**Contacts**If you have any questions, concerns, or suggestions regarding health, safety, or environmental issues, please don't hesitate to reach out to\nthe HSE team.**[Вера Коншина](https://staff.yandex-team.ru/verakonshina) - Head of HSE department**\\**[Мария Валиева](https://staff.yandex-team.ru/valievamv) - HSE\nspecialist**We are here to support you, address your concerns, and help ensure a safe and healthy working environment for everyone.\n\nYour feedback and observations are invaluable in maintaining a culture of safety and continuous improvement.

It is a\nmultidisciplinary field that focuses on managing and ensuring the well-being of individuals and the protection of the environment within\nvarious settings, including workplaces, communities, and public spaces. EHS encompasses a wide range of practices, policies, and regulations\nthat aim to prevent accidents, injuries, and illnesses while minimizing the negative impact on the environment.\n\nThe primary objectives of EHS are to create safe and healthy working conditions, promote sustainable practices, and comply with legal\nrequirements to safeguard both employees and the surrounding environment. By integrating these three essential components --\nEnvironment, Health, and Safety -- organizations can proactively identify and mitigate potential hazards, reduce risks, and enhance\noverall performance.\n\nKey aspects of EHS include:\n1. Environment: This aspect addresses the impact of human activities on\n    the natural world. It involves assessing and managing issues such as air and water quality, waste management, energy efficiency, and the\n    conservation of natural resources. By implementing environmentally responsible practices, organizations can contribute to a greener and\n    more sustainable future.\n2. Health: EHS aims to protect the health and well-being of\n    individuals, whether they are employees, customers, or residents of nearby communities. This involves identifying workplace hazards,\n    promoting healthy behaviors, providing proper training, and offering access to medical services to prevent and address illnesses and\n    injuries.\n3. Safety: Safety is a fundamental aspect of EHS, focusing on\n    preventing accidents and injuries in various settings. Workplace safety measures can include ergonomic assessments, machine guarding,\n    safety training, and emergency preparedness to ensure the physical well-being of employees and visitors.\n\nAdopting a robust EHS program not only helps organizations maintain a positive reputation but also enhances productivity and efficiency by\nreducing downtime due to accidents or environmental incidents. Additionally, it demonstrates a commitment to social responsibility and\nsustainability, which is increasingly important in today's world.\n\nOverall, EHS plays a vital role in maintaining a healthy workforce, protecting the environment, and contributing to the long-term success\nand resilience of businesses and communities alike.**Courses**[**Course health safety at work in English**](https://quantum.yandex-team.ru/courses/HESAWORK19)\n\n[**Course health safety at work in Georgian**](https://quantum.yandex-team.ru/courses/HSEWORK19_GE)\n\n[**Course health safety at work in Armenian**](https://quantum.yandex-team.ru/courses/HSEWORK19_HY)\n\n[**Course health safety at work in Spanish**](https://quantum.yandex-team.ru/courses/HSEWORK19_ES)\n\n[**Course health safety at work in Azerbaijani**](https://quantum.yandex-team.ru/courses/HSEWORK19_AZ)\n\n[**Course health safety at work in Turkish**](https://quantum.yandex-team.ru/courses/HSEWORK19_TR)\n\n[**Course health safety at work in French**](https://quantum.yandex-team.ru/courses/HSEWORK19_FR)\n\n[**Course health safety at work in Arabian**](https://quantum.yandex-team.ru/courses/HSEWORK19_AR)\n\n[**Covid-19 info course**](https://quantum.yandex-team.ru/courses/010203)**Risk reduction**Assessment of professional risks\n\nIdentification of hazards: identify potential hazards in the office, including ergonomic issues, electrical malfunctions, and chemical\nexposures (detecting all risks related to equipment, environment, or processes).\n\nRisk Evaluation: analyzing the likelihood and severity of harm from each hazard - use checklists, inspections, and incident reports to assess\nrisks (Tickets system in Yango).\n\nRisk reduction measures: developing strategies to minimize risks, such as safety protocols, training, and protective measures as well as\nimplement engineering controls, administrative policies, and personal protective equipment to mitigate identified risks.\n\nRisks hunting\n\nReporting safety concerns is crucial for maintaining a secure workplace. Employees can promptly identify and report hazards through the HSE\nreporting form:\n\n[  HSE risks hunting (en)](https://forms.yandex-team.ru/ext/surveys/13704655/)\n\nThis proactive approach helps the HSE team investigate and implement corrective actions, preventing future incidents. Open communication\nfosters a culture of safety and ensures timely resolution of issues, protecting everyone in the workplace.\n\nNear Miss\n\nNear miss is an unplanned event that didn't result in injury, illness or damage -- but had the potential to do so.\n\nHazard communication\n\nHazard communication ensures that employees are informed about potential risks in the workplace. Open communication channels allow employees to\nreport and address hazards promptly.\n\nBy promoting transparency and awareness, hazard communication helps prevent accidents and fosters a safer work environment where everyone\nunderstands and complies with safety protocols.\n\nInformation about risks\n\nEmployees receive timely information about risks through:\n- Security guides\n- Meetings and trainings\n- Information materials in public places\n- Wiki pages\n- Safety signs\n- Briefings\n- Documents, tickets and feedback\n- Registers with employee signatures\n- Feedback channels\n\nYango has internally established protocols for quickly informing employees about risks and dangers. In addition, in each country we\norganize internal emergency services from volunteers for timely monitoring and management of emergency situations, evacuations and first\naid.\n\nPlease report near miss directly via hse@yango.com**Contacts**If you have any questions, concerns, or suggestions regarding health, safety, or environmental issues, please don't hesitate to reach out to\nthe HSE team.**[Вера Коншина](https://staff.yandex-team.ru/verakonshina) - Head of HSE department**\\**[Мария Валиева](https://staff.yandex-team.ru/valievamv) - HSE\nspecialist**We are here to support you, address your concerns, and help ensure a safe and healthy working environment for everyone.\n\nYour feedback and observations are invaluable in maintaining a culture of safety and continuous improvement.

It is a\nmultidisciplinary field that focuses on managing and ensuring the well-being of individuals and the protection of the environment within\nvarious settings, including workplaces, communities, and public spaces. EHS encompasses a wide range of practices, policies, and regulations\nthat aim to prevent accidents, injuries, and illnesses while minimizing the negative impact on the environment.\n\nThe primary objectives of EHS are to create safe and healthy working conditions, promote sustainable practices, and comply with legal\nrequirements to safeguard both employees and the surrounding environment. By integrating these three essential components --\nEnvironment, Health, and Safety -- organizations can proactively identify and mitigate potential hazards, reduce risks, and enhance\noverall performance.\n\nKey aspects of EHS include:\n1. Environment: This aspect addresses the impact of human activities on\n    the natural world. It involves assessing and managing issues such as air and water quality, waste management, energy efficiency, and the\n    conservation of natural resources. By implementing environmentally responsible practices, organizations can contribute to a greener and\n    more sustainable future.\n2. Health: EHS aims to protect the health and well-being of\n    individuals, whether they are employees, customers, or residents of nearby communities. This involves identifying workplace hazards,\n    promoting healthy behaviors, providing proper training, and offering access to medical services to prevent and address illnesses and\n    injuries.\n3. Safety: Safety is a fundamental aspect of EHS, focusing on\n    preventing accidents and injuries in various settings. Workplace safety measures can include ergonomic assessments, machine guarding,\n    safety training, and emergency preparedness to ensure the physical well-being of employees and visitors.\n\nAdopting a robust EHS program not only helps organizations maintain a positive reputation but also enhances productivity and efficiency by\nreducing downtime due to accidents or environmental incidents. Additionally, it demonstrates a commitment to social responsibility and\nsustainability, which is increasingly important in today's world.\n\nOverall, EHS plays a vital role in maintaining a healthy workforce, protecting the environment, and contributing to the long-term success\nand resilience of businesses and communities alike.**Courses**[**Course health safety at work in English**](https://quantum.yandex-team.ru/courses/HESAWORK19)\n\n[**Course health safety at work in Georgian**](https://quantum.yandex-team.ru/courses/HSEWORK19_GE)\n\n[**Course health safety at work in Armenian**](https://quantum.yandex-team.ru/courses/HSEWORK19_HY)\n\n[**Course health safety at work in Spanish**](https://quantum.yandex-team.ru/courses/HSEWORK19_ES)\n\n[**Course health safety at work in Azerbaijani**](https://quantum.yandex-team.ru/courses/HSEWORK19_AZ)\n\n[**Course health safety at work in Turkish**](https://quantum.yandex-team.ru/courses/HSEWORK19_TR)\n\n[**Course health safety at work in French**](https://quantum.yandex-team.ru/courses/HSEWORK19_FR)\n\n[**Course health safety at work in Arabian**](https://quantum.yandex-team.ru/courses/HSEWORK19_AR)\n\n[**Covid-19 info course**](https://quantum.yandex-team.ru/courses/010203)**Risk reduction**Assessment of professional risks\n\nIdentification of hazards: identify potential hazards in the office, including ergonomic issues, electrical malfunctions, and chemical\nexposures (detecting all risks related to equipment, environment, or processes).\n\nRisk Evaluation: analyzing the likelihood and severity of harm from each hazard - use checklists, inspections, and incident reports to assess\nrisks (Tickets system in Yango).\n\nRisk reduction measures: developing strategies to minimize risks, such as safety protocols, training, and protective measures as well as\nimplement engineering controls, administrative policies, and personal protective equipment to mitigate identified risks.\n\nRisks hunting\n\nReporting safety concerns is crucial for maintaining a secure workplace. Employees can promptly identify and report hazards through the HSE\nreporting form:\n\n[  HSE risks hunting (en)](https://forms.yandex-team.ru/ext/surveys/13704655/)\n\nThis proactive approach helps the HSE team investigate and implement corrective actions, preventing future incidents. Open communication\nfosters a culture of safety and ensures timely resolution of issues, protecting everyone in the workplace.\n\nNear Miss\n\nNear miss is an unplanned event that didn't result in injury, illness or damage -- but had the potential to do so.\n\nHazard communication\n\nHazard communication ensures that employees are informed about potential risks in the workplace. Open communication channels allow employees to\nreport and address hazards promptly.\n\nBy promoting transparency and awareness, hazard communication helps prevent accidents and fosters a safer work environment where everyone\nunderstands and complies with safety protocols.\n\nInformation about risks\n\nEmployees receive timely information about risks through:\n- Security guides\n- Meetings and trainings\n- Information materials in public places\n- Wiki pages\n- Safety signs\n- Briefings\n- Documents, tickets and feedback\n- Registers with employee signatures\n- Feedback channels\n\nYango has internally established protocols for quickly informing employees about risks and dangers. In addition, in each country we\norganize internal emergency services from volunteers for timely monitoring and management of emergency situations, evacuations and first\naid.\n\nPlease report near miss directly via hse@yango.com**Contacts**If you have any questions, concerns, or suggestions regarding health, safety, or environmental issues, please don't hesitate to reach out to\nthe HSE team.**[Вера Коншина](https://staff.yandex-team.ru/verakonshina) - Head of HSE department**\\**[Мария Валиева](https://staff.yandex-team.ru/valievamv) - HSE\nspecialist**We are here to support you, address your concerns, and help ensure a safe and healthy working environment for everyone.\n\nYour feedback and observations are invaluable in maintaining a culture of safety and continuous improvement.

It is a\nmultidisciplinary field that focuses on managing and ensuring the well-being of individuals and the protection of the environment within\nvarious settings, including workplaces, communities, and public spaces. EHS encompasses a wide range of practices, policies, and regulations\nthat aim to prevent accidents, injuries, and illnesses while minimizing the negative impact on the environment.\n\nThe primary objectives of EHS are to create safe and healthy working conditions, promote sustainable practices, and comply with legal\nrequirements to safeguard both employees and the surrounding environment. By integrating these three essential components --\nEnvironment, Health, and Safety -- organizations can proactively identify and mitigate potential hazards, reduce risks, and enhance\noverall performance.**Key aspects of EHS include:**1. Environment: This aspect addresses the impact of human activities on the natural world. It involves assessing and managing issues such as\n    air and water quality, waste management, energy efficiency, and the conservation of natural resources. By implementing environmentally\n    responsible practices, organizations can contribute to a greener and more sustainable future.\n2. Health: EHS aims to protect the health and well-being of\n    individuals, whether they are employees, customers, or residents of nearby communities. This involves identifying workplace hazards,\n    promoting healthy behaviors, providing proper training, and offering access to medical services to prevent and address illnesses and\n    injuries.\n3. Safety: Safety is a fundamental aspect of EHS, focusing on\n    preventing accidents and injuries in various settings. Workplace safety measures can include ergonomic assessments, machine guarding,\n    safety training, and emergency preparedness to ensure the physical well-being of employees and visitors.\n\nAdopting a robust EHS program not only helps organizations maintain a positive reputation but also enhances productivity and efficiency by\nreducing downtime due to accidents or environmental incidents. Additionally, it demonstrates a commitment to social responsibility and\nsustainability, which is increasingly important in today's world.\n\nOverall, EHS plays a vital role in maintaining a healthy workforce, protecting the environment, and contributing to the long-term success\nand resilience of businesses and communities alike.**Risk Reduction****Assessment of professional risks****Identification of hazards:**identify potential hazards in the office, including ergonomic issues, electrical malfunctions, and chemical\nexposures (detecting all risks related to equipment, environment, or processes).**Risk Evaluation:**analyzing the likelihood and severity of harm from\neach hazard - use checklists, inspections, and incident reports to assess risks (Tickets system in Yango).**Risk reduction measures:**developing strategies to minimize risks,\nsuch as safety protocols, training, and protective measures as well as implement engineering controls, administrative policies, and personal\nprotective equipment to mitigate identified risks.**Risks hunting**Reporting safety concerns is crucial for maintaining a secure workplace. Employees can promptly identify and report hazards through the HSE\nreporting form: [HSE risks hunting (en)](https://forms.yandex-team.ru/ext/surveys/13704655/).\n\nThis proactive approach helps the HSE team investigate and implement corrective actions, preventing future incidents. Open communication\nfosters a culture of safety and ensures timely resolution of issues, protecting everyone in the workplace.**Near Miss**Near miss is an unplanned event that didn't result in injury, illness or\ndamage -- but had the potential to do so.**Hazard communication**Hazard communication ensures that employees are informed about potential risks in the workplace. Open communication channels allow employees to\nreport and address hazards promptly.\n\nBy promoting transparency and awareness, hazard communication helps prevent accidents and fosters a safer work environment where everyone\nunderstands and complies with safety protocols.**Information about risks**Employees receive timely information about risks through:\n- Security guides\n- Meetings and trainings\n- Information materials in public places\n- Wiki pages\n- Safety signs\n- Briefings\n- Documents, tickets and feedback\n- Registers with employee signatures\n- Feedback channels\n\nYango has internally established protocols for quickly informing employees about risks and dangers. In addition, in each country we\norganize internal emergency services from volunteers for timely monitoring and management of emergency situations, evacuations and first\naid.\n\nPlease report near miss directly via hse@yango.com**Ergonomics**The goal of our Ergonomics Program is to improve system and task design so that safety, health, comfort, and performance is maintained. Many\nfactors play a role in ergonomics. These include body posture and movement (e.g., sitting, standing, lifting, pulling, and pushing),\nenvironmental factors (e.g., noise, vibration, illumination, climate) and processing of information (i.e., gained visually or through other\nsenses).**Risk factors include:**- Sustained or awkward body postures\n- Excessive repetitive motions\n- Excessive or sustained force\n- Mechanical or contact stress\n- Muscle tension**Prevention is key. Here are some suggestions and tools to help you\navoid ergonomic issues:**- [Ergonomic Guidelines for Setting up Your Computer Workstation](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F8_ME4VwTiw)\n- [Office Ergonomics: Simple solutions for comfort and\n  safety](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ofnpBtO1-gA)\n- [Ergonomics wrist](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTSuhjpSLHg)\n- [Ergonomics Shoulder](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1vNbBCGgfe8)\n- [Ergonomics Neck](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fa4SFs85too)\n\nRemember to report any symptoms such as soreness, stiffness, burning, aching, numbness or weakness to your manager or to the EHS department.\nIf you are uncomfortable for any reason, ask for help.**HSE Team**If you have any questions, concerns, or suggestions regarding health, safety, or environmental issues, please don't hesitate to reach out to\nthe HSE team.\n\n[Vera Konshina](https://staff.yandex-team.ru/verakonshina)**- Head of HSE department**\\\n[Mariia Valieva****](https://staff.yandex-team.ru/valievamv)**- HSE specialist**We are here to support you, address your concerns, and help ensure a\nsafe and healthy working environment for everyone.\n\nYour feedback and observations are invaluable in maintaining a culture of safety and continuous improvement.

It is a\nmultidisciplinary field that focuses on managing and ensuring the well-being of individuals and the protection of the environment within\nvarious settings, including workplaces, communities, and public spaces. EHS encompasses a wide range of practices, policies, and regulations\nthat aim to prevent accidents, injuries, and illnesses while minimizing the negative impact on the environment.\n\nThe primary objectives of EHS are to create safe and healthy working conditions, promote sustainable practices, and comply with legal\nrequirements to safeguard both employees and the surrounding environment. By integrating these three essential components --\nEnvironment, Health, and Safety -- organizations can proactively identify and mitigate potential hazards, reduce risks, and enhance\noverall performance.**Key aspects of EHS include:**1. Environment: This aspect addresses the impact of human activities on the natural world. It involves assessing and managing issues such as\n    air and water quality, waste management, energy efficiency, and the conservation of natural resources. By implementing environmentally\n    responsible practices, organizations can contribute to a greener and more sustainable future.\n2. Health: EHS aims to protect the health and well-being of\n    individuals, whether they are employees, customers, or residents of nearby communities. This involves identifying workplace hazards,\n    promoting healthy behaviors, providing proper training, and offering access to medical services to prevent and address illnesses and\n    injuries.\n3. Safety: Safety is a fundamental aspect of EHS, focusing on\n    preventing accidents and injuries in various settings. Workplace safety measures can include ergonomic assessments, machine guarding,\n    safety training, and emergency preparedness to ensure the physical well-being of employees and visitors.\n\nAdopting a robust EHS program not only helps organizations maintain a positive reputation but also enhances productivity and efficiency by\nreducing downtime due to accidents or environmental incidents. Additionally, it demonstrates a commitment to social responsibility and\nsustainability, which is increasingly important in today's world.\n\nOverall, EHS plays a vital role in maintaining a healthy workforce, protecting the environment, and contributing to the long-term success\nand resilience of businesses and communities alike.**Risk Reduction****Assessment of professional risks****Identification of hazards:**identify potential hazards in the office, including ergonomic issues, electrical malfunctions, and chemical\nexposures (detecting all risks related to equipment, environment, or processes).**Risk Evaluation:**analyzing the likelihood and severity of harm from\neach hazard - use checklists, inspections, and incident reports to assess risks (Tickets system in Yango).**Risk reduction measures:**developing strategies to minimize risks,\nsuch as safety protocols, training, and protective measures as well as implement engineering controls, administrative policies, and personal\nprotective equipment to mitigate identified risks.**Risks hunting**Reporting safety concerns is crucial for maintaining a secure workplace. Employees can promptly identify and report hazards through the HSE\nreporting form: [HSE risks hunting (en)](https://forms.yandex-team.ru/ext/surveys/13704655/).\n\nThis proactive approach helps the HSE team investigate and implement corrective actions, preventing future incidents. Open communication\nfosters a culture of safety and ensures timely resolution of issues, protecting everyone in the workplace.**Near Miss**Near miss is an unplanned event that didn't result in injury, illness or\ndamage -- but had the potential to do so.**Hazard communication**Hazard communication ensures that employees are informed about potential risks in the workplace. Open communication channels allow employees to\nreport and address hazards promptly.\n\nBy promoting transparency and awareness, hazard communication helps prevent accidents and fosters a safer work environment where everyone\nunderstands and complies with safety protocols.**Information about risks**Employees receive timely information about risks through:\n- Security guides\n- Meetings and trainings\n- Information materials in public places\n- Wiki pages\n- Safety signs\n- Briefings\n- Documents, tickets and feedback\n- Registers with employee signatures\n- Feedback channels\n\nYango has internally established protocols for quickly informing employees about risks and dangers. In addition, in each country we\norganize internal emergency services from volunteers for timely monitoring and management of emergency situations, evacuations and first\naid.\n\nPlease report near miss directly via hse@yango.com**Ergonomics**The goal of our Ergonomics Program is to improve system and task design so that safety, health, comfort, and performance is maintained. Many\nfactors play a role in ergonomics. These include body posture and movement (e.g., sitting, standing, lifting, pulling, and pushing),\nenvironmental factors (e.g., noise, vibration, illumination, climate) and processing of information (i.e., gained visually or through other\nsenses).**Risk factors include:**- Sustained or awkward body postures\n- Excessive repetitive motions\n- Excessive or sustained force\n- Mechanical or contact stress\n- Muscle tension**Prevention is key. Here are some suggestions and tools to help you\navoid ergonomic issues:**- [Ergonomic Guidelines for Setting up Your Computer Workstation](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F8_ME4VwTiw)\n- [Office Ergonomics: Simple solutions for comfort and\n  safety](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ofnpBtO1-gA)\n- [Ergonomics wrist](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTSuhjpSLHg)\n- [Ergonomics Shoulder](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1vNbBCGgfe8)\n- [Ergonomics Neck](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fa4SFs85too)\n\nRemember to report any symptoms such as soreness, stiffness, burning, aching, numbness or weakness to your manager or to the EHS department.\nIf you are uncomfortable for any reason, ask for help.**HSE Team**If you have any questions, concerns, or suggestions regarding health, safety, or environmental issues, please don't hesitate to reach out to\nthe HSE team.\n\n[Vera Konshina](https://staff.yandex-team.ru/verakonshina)**- Head of HSE department**\\\n[Mariia Valieva****](https://staff.yandex-team.ru/valievamv)**- HSE specialist**We are here to support you, address your concerns, and help ensure a\nsafe and healthy working environment for everyone.\n\nYour feedback and observations are invaluable in maintaining a culture of safety and continuous improvement.

It is a\nmultidisciplinary field that focuses on managing and ensuring the well-being of individuals and the protection of the environment within\nvarious settings, including workplaces, communities, and public spaces. EHS encompasses a wide range of practices, policies, and regulations\nthat aim to prevent accidents, injuries, and illnesses while minimizing the negative impact on the environment.\n\nThe primary objectives of EHS are to create safe and healthy working conditions, promote sustainable practices, and comply with legal\nrequirements to safeguard both employees and the surrounding environment. By integrating these three essential components --\nEnvironment, Health, and Safety -- organizations can proactively identify and mitigate potential hazards, reduce risks, and enhance\noverall performance.**Key aspects of EHS include:**1. Environment: This aspect addresses the impact of human activities on the natural world. It involves assessing and managing issues such as\n    air and water quality, waste management, energy efficiency, and the conservation of natural resources. By implementing environmentally\n    responsible practices, organizations can contribute to a greener and more sustainable future.\n2. Health: EHS aims to protect the health and well-being of\n    individuals, whether they are employees, customers, or residents of nearby communities. This involves identifying workplace hazards,\n    promoting healthy behaviors, providing proper training, and offering access to medical services to prevent and address illnesses and\n    injuries.\n3. Safety: Safety is a fundamental aspect of EHS, focusing on\n    preventing accidents and injuries in various settings. Workplace safety measures can include ergonomic assessments, machine guarding,\n    safety training, and emergency preparedness to ensure the physical well-being of employees and visitors.\n\nAdopting a robust EHS program not only helps organizations maintain a positive reputation but also enhances productivity and efficiency by\nreducing downtime due to accidents or environmental incidents. Additionally, it demonstrates a commitment to social responsibility and\nsustainability, which is increasingly important in today's world.\n\nOverall, EHS plays a vital role in maintaining a healthy workforce, protecting the environment, and contributing to the long-term success\nand resilience of businesses and communities alike.**Risk Reduction****Assessment of professional risks****Identification of hazards:**identify potential hazards in the office, including ergonomic issues, electrical malfunctions, and chemical\nexposures (detecting all risks related to equipment, environment, or processes).**Risk Evaluation:**analyzing the likelihood and severity of harm from\neach hazard - use checklists, inspections, and incident reports to assess risks (Tickets system in Yango).**Risk reduction measures:**developing strategies to minimize risks,\nsuch as safety protocols, training, and protective measures as well as implement engineering controls, administrative policies, and personal\nprotective equipment to mitigate identified risks.**Risks hunting**Reporting safety concerns is crucial for maintaining a secure workplace. Employees can promptly identify and report hazards through the HSE\nreporting form: [HSE risks hunting (en)](https://forms.yandex-team.ru/ext/surveys/13704655/).\n\nThis proactive approach helps the HSE team investigate and implement corrective actions, preventing future incidents. Open communication\nfosters a culture of safety and ensures timely resolution of issues, protecting everyone in the workplace.**Near Miss**Near miss is an unplanned event that didn't result in injury, illness or\ndamage -- but had the potential to do so.**Hazard communication**Hazard communication ensures that employees are informed about potential risks in the workplace. Open communication channels allow employees to\nreport and address hazards promptly.\n\nBy promoting transparency and awareness, hazard communication helps prevent accidents and fosters a safer work environment where everyone\nunderstands and complies with safety protocols.**Information about risks**Employees receive timely information about risks through:\n- Security guides\n- Meetings and trainings\n- Information materials in public places\n- Wiki pages\n- Safety signs\n- Briefings\n- Documents, tickets and feedback\n- Registers with employee signatures\n- Feedback channels\n\nYango has internally established protocols for quickly informing employees about risks and dangers. In addition, in each country we\norganize internal emergency services from volunteers for timely monitoring and management of emergency situations, evacuations and first\naid.\n\nPlease report near miss directly via hse@yango.com**Ergonomics**The goal of our Ergonomics Program is to improve system and task design so that safety, health, comfort, and performance is maintained. Many\nfactors play a role in ergonomics. These include body posture and movement (e.g., sitting, standing, lifting, pulling, and pushing),\nenvironmental factors (e.g., noise, vibration, illumination, climate) and processing of information (i.e., gained visually or through other\nsenses).**Risk factors include:**- Sustained or awkward body postures\n- Excessive repetitive motions\n- Excessive or sustained force\n- Mechanical or contact stress\n- Muscle tension**Prevention is key. Here are some suggestions and tools to help you\navoid ergonomic issues:**- [Ergonomic Guidelines for Setting up Your Computer Workstation](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F8_ME4VwTiw)\n- [Office Ergonomics: Simple solutions for comfort and\n  safety](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ofnpBtO1-gA)\n- [Ergonomics wrist](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTSuhjpSLHg)\n- [Ergonomics Shoulder](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1vNbBCGgfe8)\n- [Ergonomics Neck](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fa4SFs85too)\n\nRemember to report any symptoms such as soreness, stiffness, burning, aching, numbness or weakness to your manager or to the EHS department.\nIf you are uncomfortable for any reason, ask for help.**HSE Team**If you have any questions, concerns, or suggestions regarding health, safety, or environmental issues, please don't hesitate to reach out to\nthe HSE team.\n\n[Vera Konshina](https://staff.yandex-team.ru/verakonshina)**- Head of HSE department**\\\n[Mariia Valieva****](https://staff.yandex-team.ru/valievamv)**- HSE specialist**We are here to support you, address your concerns, and help ensure a\nsafe and healthy working environment for everyone.\n\nYour feedback and observations are invaluable in maintaining a culture of safety and continuous improvement.

It is a\nmultidisciplinary field that focuses on managing and ensuring the well-being of individuals and the protection of the environment within\nvarious settings, including workplaces, communities, and public spaces. EHS encompasses a wide range of practices, policies, and regulations\nthat aim to prevent accidents, injuries, and illnesses while minimizing the negative impact on the environment.\n\nThe primary objectives of EHS are to create safe and healthy working conditions, promote sustainable practices, and comply with legal\nrequirements to safeguard both employees and the surrounding environment. By integrating these three essential components --\nEnvironment, Health, and Safety -- organizations can proactively identify and mitigate potential hazards, reduce risks, and enhance\noverall performance.**Key aspects of EHS include:**1. Environment: This aspect addresses the impact of human activities on the natural world. It involves assessing and managing issues such as\n    air and water quality, waste management, energy efficiency, and the conservation of natural resources. By implementing environmentally\n    responsible practices, organizations can contribute to a greener and more sustainable future.\n2. Health: EHS aims to protect the health and well-being of\n    individuals, whether they are employees, customers, or residents of nearby communities. This involves identifying workplace hazards,\n    promoting healthy behaviors, providing proper training, and offering access to medical services to prevent and address illnesses and\n    injuries.\n3. Safety: Safety is a fundamental aspect of EHS, focusing on\n    preventing accidents and injuries in various settings. Workplace safety measures can include ergonomic assessments, machine guarding,\n    safety training, and emergency preparedness to ensure the physical well-being of employees and visitors.\n\nAdopting a robust EHS program not only helps organizations maintain a positive reputation but also enhances productivity and efficiency by\nreducing downtime due to accidents or environmental incidents. Additionally, it demonstrates a commitment to social responsibility and\nsustainability, which is increasingly important in today's world.\n\nOverall, EHS plays a vital role in maintaining a healthy workforce, protecting the environment, and contributing to the long-term success\nand resilience of businesses and communities alike.**Risk Reduction****Assessment of professional risks****Identification of hazards:**identify potential hazards in the office, including ergonomic issues, electrical malfunctions, and chemical\nexposures (detecting all risks related to equipment, environment, or processes).**Risk Evaluation:**analyzing the likelihood and severity of harm from\neach hazard - use checklists, inspections, and incident reports to assess risks (Tickets system in Yango).**Risk reduction measures:**developing strategies to minimize risks,\nsuch as safety protocols, training, and protective measures as well as implement engineering controls, administrative policies, and personal\nprotective equipment to mitigate identified risks.**Risks hunting**Reporting safety concerns is crucial for maintaining a secure workplace. Employees can promptly identify and report hazards through the HSE\nreporting form: [HSE risks hunting (en)](https://forms.yandex-team.ru/ext/surveys/13704655/).\n\nThis proactive approach helps the HSE team investigate and implement corrective actions, preventing future incidents. Open communication\nfosters a culture of safety and ensures timely resolution of issues, protecting everyone in the workplace.**Near Miss**Near miss is an unplanned event that didn't result in injury, illness or\ndamage -- but had the potential to do so.**Hazard communication**Hazard communication ensures that employees are informed about potential risks in the workplace. Open communication channels allow employees to\nreport and address hazards promptly.\n\nBy promoting transparency and awareness, hazard communication helps prevent accidents and fosters a safer work environment where everyone\nunderstands and complies with safety protocols.**Information about risks**Employees receive timely information about risks through:\n- Security guides\n- Meetings and trainings\n- Information materials in public places\n- Wiki pages\n- Safety signs\n- Briefings\n- Documents, tickets and feedback\n- Registers with employee signatures\n- Feedback channels\n\nYango has internally established protocols for quickly informing employees about risks and dangers. In addition, in each country we\norganize internal emergency services from volunteers for timely monitoring and management of emergency situations, evacuations and first\naid.\n\nPlease report near miss directly via hse@yango.com**Ergonomics**The goal of our Ergonomics Program is to improve system and task design so that safety, health, comfort, and performance is maintained. Many\nfactors play a role in ergonomics. These include body posture and movement (e.g., sitting, standing, lifting, pulling, and pushing),\nenvironmental factors (e.g., noise, vibration, illumination, climate) and processing of information (i.e., gained visually or through other\nsenses).**Risk factors include:**- Sustained or awkward body postures\n- Excessive repetitive motions\n- Excessive or sustained force\n- Mechanical or contact stress\n- Muscle tension**Prevention is key. Here are some suggestions and tools to help you\navoid ergonomic issues:**- [Ergonomic Guidelines for Setting up Your Computer Workstation](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F8_ME4VwTiw)\n- [Office Ergonomics: Simple solutions for comfort and\n  safety](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ofnpBtO1-gA)\n- [Ergonomics wrist](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTSuhjpSLHg)\n- [Ergonomics Shoulder](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1vNbBCGgfe8)\n- [Ergonomics Neck](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fa4SFs85too)\n\nRemember to report any symptoms such as soreness, stiffness, burning, aching, numbness or weakness to your manager or to the EHS department.\nIf you are uncomfortable for any reason, ask for help.**HSE Team**If you have any questions, concerns, or suggestions regarding health, safety, or environmental issues, please don't hesitate to reach out to\nthe HSE team.\n\n[Vera Konshina](https://staff.yandex-team.ru/verakonshina)**- Head of HSE department**\\\n[Mariia Valieva****](https://staff.yandex-team.ru/valievamv)**- HSE specialist**We are here to support you, address your concerns, and help ensure a\nsafe and healthy working environment for everyone.\n\nYour feedback and observations are invaluable in maintaining a culture of safety and continuous improvement.
