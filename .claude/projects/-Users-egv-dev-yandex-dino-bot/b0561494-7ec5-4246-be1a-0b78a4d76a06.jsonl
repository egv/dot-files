While we use them to do our banking, we respect each employee’s decision\nto choose a bank based on individual preferences.\nFeel free to explore the number of banks available in the UAE on this website.\nFor those who wish to use Emirates NBD, we can assist you with opening an account. Our team will coordinate a visit from the bank\nrepresentative to our office, who will help set up your account. Please note that your presence in the country is essential during the\nvisit and when collecting your bank cards.\nHow to open bank account:\nBank representative’s visit to the office. You must have with you:\nEmirates ID (original);\nPassport (original);\nVisa (copy);\nApplication form (provided by HR);\nValid UAE mobile number.\nDebit card and cheque book\nA new bank account is usually ready for use within 48-72 hours after the application submission. Debit card + cheque book take up\nto 5 days to arrive after the 1st confirmation email.\nCredit card\nAvailable after the first salary is deposited following the 2nd confirmation email.\nBank contact:\nName: Mr Ravi S.\nPosition: Account Manager\nEmail: RaviSR@EmiratesNBD.com\nBanking dos and don’ts\nDon’ts\nAvoid making regular cash deposits into your account. This could raise compliance issues with the bank and potentially lead to the\npermanent blacklisting of your account.\nDo not use your account for any business activity. Your bank account should only be used for personal transactions.\nTry to limit regular transfers to and from Russia. If such transfers are necessary, keep them to a bare minimum and ensure you can\nprovide proof of income. Please note that the UAE Central Bank reserves the right to block any transfers at their discretion.\nAvoid lending funds to or borrowing from colleagues via account transfers. All employees must be able to provide proof of income at\nall times. Receiving funds from friends does not qualify as a legitimate source of income.\nNever:\n* use an ATM that has a blank screen;\n* insert your card into an ATM until the display screen has specifically instructed you to do so.\nDos\nTo prevent fraudulent activities, write out the full four digits of the year instead of just the last two digits when issuing cheques. For\nexample, write 01/03/2023 or March 1, 2023 instead of 01/03/23 or March 1, 23. This will help prevent any potential manipulation of\nthe cheque’s date.\nRemember to place an immediate “stop payment” on any lost or missing cheques.\nBe mindful of your cards’ daily withdrawal limits and consider adjusting them accordingly for improved security or any other specific\nneeds.\nYour cheque book should be used sparingly and only for legally-binding transactions such as renting homes.\nAlways ensure that you have sufficient funds in your account. Bouncing a cheque is a criminal offense in the UAE and can result in the\npermanent closure of your account.\nRemember that UAE banks do not issue separate cards in USD (American dollars). All your bank cards will be denominated in AED\n(Emirati dirhams).\nEssential apps to download\nApps\nThe UAE Pass\nApp Store\nGoogle Play\nThe UAE Pass is the first national digital identity solution, allowing users to authenticate themselves to government service providers\nacross the whole of the UAE using their smartphones.

Dubai offers an\n   194\tincredible mix of entertainment, beaches and city life for all ages and cultures. The year-round warm weather and beautiful sunny\n   195\tsettings are further reasons why Dubai has become a frequented holiday destination. The city is also very safe, easily accessible and\n   196\toffers all the modern amenities.\n   197\tAlthough Arabic is the official language in Dubai, English is most commonly spoken given the high number of foreign nationals.\n   198\tLocals typically take Fridays as their day of worship, which results in a shorter working day (government sector), while Saturday and\n   199\tSunday being the official weekend in the UAE.\n   200\tAs it is a multicultural environment, you should be aware of the many religious celebrations that divide the calendar throughout the\n   201\tyear in the UAE. One of the most important, Ramadan, is an event every spring where you will need to be sensitive to the daytime\n   202\tfasting observed across the nation during this period.\n   203\tUAE Public Holidays in 2024:\n   204\tNew Year’s Day (Monday, January 1)\n   205\tEid al Fitr Holidays (April 8-12)\n   206\tArafat Day & Eid al Adha Holidays (June 15-18)\n   207\tIslamic New Year (July 7)\n   208\tProphet Muhammad’s (PBUH) Birthday (September 15)\n   209\tNational Day (December 1-3)\n   210\tCultural etiquette and social conduct\n   211\tSocial conduct\n   212\tIn the UAE, business etiquette is profoundly anchored in religiosity and respect, given the nation’s Islamic heritage. With that in mind,\n   213\tit's crucial to recognize the significance and influence of Islam in the UAE's business environment. Awareness of these cultural\n   214\tintricacies is essential for decorum (social standards) and legal compliance, as specific laws in the UAE are derived from Sharia law. For\n   215\tinstance, photographing someone without their consent or derogatory remarks about Islam are serious offenses.\n   216\tCultural etiquette and Islam\n   217\tEvery resident in the UAE is expected to respect the nation’s symbols, including the UAE flag, the UAE emblem, and the country’s royal\n   218\tfamilies. Failing to do so can result in criminal prosecution. Using swear words, derogatory language, and any form of offensive or\n   219\taggressive gestures is not only culturally frowned upon but also illegal. Such actions can result in hefty fines or even imprisonment.\n   220\tDisseminating false information, whether through spoken or written means, especially if it tarnishes the reputation or image of the\n   221\tcity, can lead to severe criminal consequences.\n   222\tBusiness Etiquette\n   223\tMeeting and greeting\n   224\tIn many ways, Emiratis prioritize personal relationships over rigid schedules and deadlines.

If you’re a man greeting\n   232\tanother male business associate, a handshake is customary and signifies respect. If you’re meeting someone of the opposite gender,\n   233\tit’s best to wait and see if they initiate a handshake before you extend your hand.\n   234\tControlled and illicit substances\n   235\tTobacco is a controlled substance in the UAE. Smoking is not allowed in any government offices, shops, and malls.

Possession,\n   240\tconsumption, purchasing, or distribution of illicit substances can result in jail time, including life imprisonment.\n   241\tAlcohol is another controlled substance in the UAE. It’s illegal to consume alcohol in all public areas.

Dubai offers an\nincredible mix of entertainment, beaches and city life for all ages and cultures. The year-round warm weather and beautiful sunny\nsettings are further reasons why Dubai has become a frequented holiday destination. The city is also very safe, easily accessible and\noffers all the modern amenities.\nAlthough Arabic is the official language in Dubai, English is most commonly spoken given the high number of foreign nationals.\nLocals typically take Fridays as their day of worship, which results in a shorter working day (government sector), while Saturday and\nSunday being the official weekend in the UAE.\nAs it is a multicultural environment, you should be aware of the many religious celebrations that divide the calendar throughout the\nyear in the UAE. One of the most important, Ramadan, is an event every spring where you will need to be sensitive to the daytime\nfasting observed across the nation during this period.\nUAE Public Holidays in 2024:\nNew Year’s Day (Monday, January 1)\nEid al Fitr Holidays (April 8-12)\nArafat Day & Eid al Adha Holidays (June 15-18)\nIslamic New Year (July 7)\nProphet Muhammad’s (PBUH) Birthday (September 15)\nNational Day (December 1-3)\nCultural etiquette and social conduct\nSocial conduct\nIn the UAE, business etiquette is profoundly anchored in religiosity and respect, given the nation’s Islamic heritage. With that in mind,\nit's crucial to recognize the significance and influence of Islam in the UAE's business environment. Awareness of these cultural\nintricacies is essential for decorum (social standards) and legal compliance, as specific laws in the UAE are derived from Sharia law. For\ninstance, photographing someone without their consent or derogatory remarks about Islam are serious offenses.\nCultural etiquette and Islam\nEvery resident in the UAE is expected to respect the nation’s symbols, including the UAE flag, the UAE emblem, and the country’s royal\nfamilies. Failing to do so can result in criminal prosecution. Using swear words, derogatory language, and any form of offensive or\naggressive gestures is not only culturally frowned upon but also illegal. Such actions can result in hefty fines or even imprisonment.\nDisseminating false information, whether through spoken or written means, especially if it tarnishes the reputation or image of the\ncity, can lead to severe criminal consequences.\nBusiness Etiquette\nMeeting and greeting\nIn many ways, Emiratis prioritize personal relationships over rigid schedules and deadlines. Trust is fundamental in Arab culture.\nThe workplace in the UAE leans towards conservatism, with a formal and hierarchy-based communication style.\nYou’re generally expected to address individuals as “Mr.\n” or “Mrs./Ms.\n”\n.\nBeginning a business meeting with casual conversation, such as inquiring about the health of family members, can set a friendly tone.\nHowever, avoiding direct questions about someone’s female family members, politics, or religion is essential. If you’re a man greeting\nanother male business associate, a handshake is customary and signifies respect. If you’re meeting someone of the opposite gender,\nit’s best to wait and see if they initiate a handshake before you extend your hand.\nControlled and illicit substances\nTobacco is a controlled substance in the UAE. Smoking is not allowed in any government offices, shops, and malls. Smoking or vaping\noutside specifically designated areas can lead to hefty fines.\nDriving under the influence is a severe offense in the UAE punishable by imprisonment, suspension of the offender’s driver’s license\nfor up to 2 years, and confiscation of their vehicle.\nThe UAE has a strict drug policy with laws that enforce ‘zero tolerance’ for all psychotropic drugs, including cannabis. Possession,\nconsumption, purchasing, or distribution of illicit substances can result in jail time, including life imprisonment.\nAlcohol is another controlled substance in the UAE. It’s illegal to consume alcohol in all public areas. Non-Muslim residents and tourists\ncan consume alcohol in designated areas, such as licensed hotels, bars, and restaurants.\nTwo liquor stores in the UAE controlled by the government can sell alcohol to non-Muslim residents for home consumption:\nMaritime & Mercantile International (MMI)\nAfrican+Eastern\nBoth require a special pass that can be obtained by going into one of the stores with your Emirates ID and submitting an application.\nPurchases and services [Daily Essentials]\nThe shops\nCatering to the large cosmopolitan population in the UAE, there are plenty of supermarkets in Dubai to make that grocery run:\nCarrefour\nWaitrose\nLulu Supermarket\nSpinneys\nSeveral online Apps also allow the ease of this being delivered to your door step:\nCareem Quik\nTalabat\nInstashop\nHealthcare\nInsurance\nThe Healthcare system in Dubai is managed by the Dubai Health Authority.

Here's what I discovered:\n\n## OpenAI Agents Python Framework\n\nThe OpenAI Agents SDK is a lightweight, powerful framework for building multi-agent workflows. It is provider-agnostic, supporting the OpenAI Responses and Chat Completions APIs, as well as 100+ other LLMs.\n\n### Key Features\n\nThe framework includes:\n- **Agents**: LLMs configured with instructions, tools, guardrails, and handoffs\n- **Handoffs**: A specialized tool call used by the Agents SDK for transferring control between agents\n- **Guardrails**: Configurable safety checks for input and output validation\n- **Tracing**: Built-in tracking of agent runs, allowing you to view, debug and optimize your workflows\n\n### GitHub Repository\n\nThe main repository is available at: **https://github.com/openai/openai-agents-python**\n\nExamples are available in the examples/agent_patterns directory, and there's also a specific examples/tools directory for tool examples.\n\n### Creating Custom Tools\n\nTools let agents take actions: things like fetching data, running code, calling external APIs, and even using a computer. There are three classes of tools in the Agent SDK:\n1. Hosted tools (e.g., web search, file search)\n2. Function calling (custom Python functions)\n3. Agents as tools\n\n### Custom Tool Example\n\nHere's how to create custom tools using the framework:\n\n```python\nimport json\nfrom typing_extensions import TypedDict, Any\nfrom agents import Agent, FunctionTool, RunContextWrapper, function_tool\n\nclass Location(TypedDict):\n    lat: float\n    long: float\n\n@function_tool\nasync def fetch_weather(location: Location) -> str:\n    \"\"\"Fetch the weather for a given location.\n\n    Args:\n        location: The location to fetch the weather for.\n    \"\"\"\n    # In real life, we'd fetch the weather from a weather API\n    return \"sunny\"\n\n@function_tool(name_override=\"fetch_data\")\ndef read_file(ctx: RunContextWrapper[Any], path: str, directory: str | None = None) -> str:\n    \"\"\"Read the contents of a file.\n    \n    Args:\n        path: The path to the file to read.\n        directory: The directory to read the file from.\n    \"\"\"\n    # In real life, we'd read the file from the file system\n    return \"<file contents>\"\n\nagent = Agent(\n    name=\"Assistant\",\n    tools=[fetch_weather, read_file],\n)\n```\n\n### How Function Tools Work\n\nThe Agents SDK will setup the tool automatically:\n- The name of the tool will be the name of the Python function (or you can provide a name)\n- Tool description will be taken from the docstring of the function (or you can provide a description)\n- The schema for the function inputs is automatically created from the function's arguments\n- Descriptions for each input are taken from the docstring of the function, unless disabled\n\nThe signature parsing is done via the inspect module. We use type annotations to understand the types for the arguments, and dynamically build a Pydantic model to represent the overall schema. It supports most types, including Python primitives, Pydantic models, TypedDicts, and more.\n\n### Installation\n\nYou can install the framework using pip:\n```bash\npip install openai-agents\n```\n\nFor voice support, install with the optional voice group: `pip install 'openai-agents[voice]'`\n\n### Basic Usage Example\n\n```python\nfrom agents import Agent, Runner\n\nagent = Agent(name=\"Assistant\", instructions=\"You are a helpful assistant\")\nresult = Runner.run_sync(agent, \"Write a haiku about recursion in programming.\")\nprint(result.final_output)\n# Code within the code,\n```\n\n### Documentation\n\nThe full documentation is available at: **https://openai.github.io/openai-agents-python/**\n\nThe framework provides a simple yet powerful way to build agent-based applications with custom tools, making it easy to extend agent capabilities with your own Python functions."}]},"uuid":"3aabdc08-3f58-4899-9dd0-98f3d3aa6f16","timestamp":"2025-05-23T03:14:02.089Z","toolUseResult":{"query":"openai-agents python framework custom tools example github","results":[{"tool_use_id":"srvtoolu_013MbjnwyExEoRpY3GHyoWoQ","content":[{"title":"GitHub - openai/openai-agents-python: A lightweight, powerful framework for multi-agent workflows","url":"https://github.com/openai/openai-agents-python"},{"title":"OpenAI Agents SDK","url":"https://openai.github.io/openai-agents-python/"},{"title":"Tools - OpenAI Agents SDK","url":"https://openai.github.io/openai-agents-python/tools/"},{"title":"New tools for building agents","url":"https://openai.com/index/new-tools-for-building-agents/"},{"title":"GitHub - openai/openai-python: The official Python library for the OpenAI API","url":"https://github.com/openai/openai-python"},{"title":"Models - OpenAI Agents SDK","url":"https://openai.github.io/openai-agents-python/models/"},{"title":"How to use any Python AI agent framework with free GitHub Models | Microsoft Community Hub","url":"https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/blog/educatordeveloperblog/how-to-use-any-python-ai-agent-framework-with-free-github-models/4403526"},{"title":"Agents - OpenAI Agents SDK","url":"https://openai.github.io/openai-agents-python/agents/"},{"title":"Agents - OpenAI API","url":"https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/agents"},{"title":"openai-agents-python/examples/tools at main · openai/openai-agents-python","url":"https://github.com/openai/openai-agents-python/tree/main/examples/tools"}]},"Based on the search results, I found detailed information about the OpenAI Agents Python framework and how to create custom tools.

When implementing features:\n\n1. Use `uv` to initialize the project if not already done:\n   ```bash\n   uv init\n   ```\n\n2. Add dependencies using:\n   ```bash\n   uv add <package>\n   ```\n\n3.

Make sure your `.env` file has the correct API keys\n2. Run: `uv run python main.py`\n\nThe bot will start and wait for user messages.

But note that the v1 here has NO relationship with the model's version.\n\n## Available Models\n\nThe deepseek-chat model has been upgraded to DeepSeek-V3. You can invoke DeepSeek-V3 by specifying model='deepseek-chat'.\n\ndeepseek-reasoner is the latest reasoning model, DeepSeek-R1, released by DeepSeek. You can invoke DeepSeek-R1 by specifying model='deepseek-reasoner'.\n\n## Example Implementation\n\n### Python Example\n```python\nfrom openai import OpenAI\n\nclient = OpenAI(\n    api_key=\"<DeepSeek API Key>\",\n    base_url=\"https://api.deepseek.com\"\n)\n\nresponse = client.chat.completions.create(\n    model=\"deepseek-chat\",\n    messages=[\n        {\"role\": \"system\", \"content\": \"You are a helpful assistant\"},\n        {\"role\": \"user\", \"content\": \"Hello\"},\n    ],\n    stream=False\n)\n\nprint(response.choices[0].message.content)\n```\n\n### JavaScript Example\n```javascript\nimport OpenAI from \"openai\";\n\nconst openai = new OpenAI({\n    baseURL: 'https://api.deepseek.com',\n    apiKey: '<DeepSeek API Key>'\n});\n\nasync function main() {\n    const completion = await openai.chat.completions.create({\n        messages: [{ role: \"system\", content: \"You are a helpful assistant.\" }],\n        model: \"deepseek-chat\",\n    });\n    \n    console.log(completion.choices[0].message.content);\n}\n\nmain();\n```\n\n## Key Points\n\n1. To use the DeepSeek API, please create an API key first at https://platform.deepseek.com/api_keys\n\n2. Once you have obtained an API key, you can access the DeepSeek API using the following example scripts\n\n3. This is a non-stream example, you can set the stream parameter to true to get stream response\n\n4. The API is fully compatible with OpenAI's SDK, making it easy to integrate if you're already using OpenAI's tools\n\n5.

Here's how to use DeepSeek with PydanticAI:\n\n### Basic Setup\n\nYou can use DeepSeek with PydanticAI by using the OpenAIModel class with a DeepSeekProvider:\n\n```python\nfrom pydantic_ai import Agent\nfrom pydantic_ai.models.openai import OpenAIModel\nfrom pydantic_ai.providers.deepseek import DeepSeekProvider\n\nmodel = OpenAIModel(\n    'deepseek-chat',\n    provider=DeepSeekProvider(api_key='your-deepseek-api-key'),\n)\nagent = Agent(model)\n```\n\n### Custom HTTP Client Configuration\n\nYou can also configure a custom HTTP client with DeepSeek:\n\n```python\nfrom httpx import AsyncClient\nfrom pydantic_ai import Agent\nfrom pydantic_ai.models.openai import OpenAIModel\nfrom pydantic_ai.providers.deepseek import DeepSeekProvider\n\ncustom_http_client = AsyncClient(timeout=30)\nmodel = OpenAIModel(\n    'deepseek-chat',\n    provider=DeepSeekProvider(\n        api_key='your-deepseek-api-key',\n        http_client=custom_http_client\n    ),\n)\nagent = Agent(model)\n```\n\n## Using DeepSeek with OpenAI SDK\n\nThe DeepSeek API uses an API format compatible with OpenAI, so you can use the OpenAI SDK by modifying the configuration:\n\n```python\n# Please install OpenAI SDK first: `pip3 install openai`\nfrom openai import OpenAI\n\nclient = OpenAI(\n    api_key=\"<DeepSeek API Key>\", \n    base_url=\"https://api.deepseek.com\"\n)\n\nresponse = client.chat.completions.create(\n    model=\"deepseek-chat\",\n    messages=[\n        {\"role\": \"system\", \"content\": \"You are a helpful assistant\"},\n        {\"role\": \"user\", \"content\": \"Hello\"},\n    ],\n    stream=False\n)\n\nprint(response.choices[0].message.content)\n```\n\n## Using DeepSeek with OpenAI Agents SDK\n\nThe OpenAI Agents SDK can use models from other providers if they offer an OpenAI-compatible API endpoint, including DeepSeek. You need to define a client using the AsyncOpenAI type and provide it with a BASE_URL and API key:\n\n```python\nimport os\nfrom openai import AsyncOpenAI\n\nBASE_URL = \"https://api.deepseek.com\"\nAPI_KEY = os.getenv(\"DEEPSEEK_API_KEY\")\n\nclient = AsyncOpenAI(base_url=BASE_URL, api_key=API_KEY)\n```\n\n## Integration with Multi-Model Systems\n\nWith tools like LangDB, you can run the same agent logic across more than 350 models, including DeepSeek, without changing your code. This allows you to use DeepSeek alongside other models in a unified system.\n\n## Key Points\n\n1. Using the OpenAI-compatible interface allows models like DeepSeek to be used more easily with frameworks designed for OpenAI\n\n2. DeepSeek offers significantly lower costs (90 percent lower) compared to OpenAI\n\n3. The OpenAI Agents SDK is provider-agnostic, supporting the OpenAI APIs as well as 100+ other LLMs\n\n4. DeepSeek's biggest advantage lies in its efficiency and cost-effectiveness\n\nThese examples show that DeepSeek can be easily integrated as a custom model provider in OpenAI-compatible frameworks by simply changing the base URL and API key configuration."}]},"uuid":"d41e402d-d32c-4e2e-95dd-6c984f403568","timestamp":"2025-05-23T03:27:50.873Z","toolUseResult":{"query":"openai-agents python framework custom model provider deepseek example","results":["I'll search for information about using DeepSeek as a custom model provider with the OpenAI-agents Python framework.",{"tool_use_id":"srvtoolu_017VYYnQdNKY8jX9T4ZMsmdb","content":[{"title":"Model Providers - PydanticAI","url":"https://ai.pydantic.dev/models/"},{"title":"OpenAI - PydanticAI","url":"https://ai.pydantic.dev/models/openai/"},{"title":"Use OpenAI Agents SDK with Gemini, Claude, DeepSeek, and 350+ Models","url":"https://blog.langdb.ai/integrate-gemini-claude-deepseek-into-agents-sdk-by-openai"},{"title":"DeepSeek 2025: Step-by-Step Guide for Building AI Apps (With Examples) - gcptutorials","url":"https://www.gcptutorials.com/post/deepseek-2025-step-by-step-guide-for-building-ai-apps-(with-examples)"},{"title":"pydantic_ai.models.openai - PydanticAI","url":"https://ai.pydantic.dev/api/models/openai/"},{"title":"OpenAI Agents SDK — Getting Started","url":"https://getstream.io/blog/openai-agents-sdk/"},{"title":"GitHub - openai/openai-agents-python: A lightweight, powerful framework for multi-agent workflows","url":"https://github.com/openai/openai-agents-python"},{"title":"How To Run OpenAI Agents SDK Locally With 100+ LLMs, and Custom Tracing","url":"https://getstream.io/blog/local-openai-agents/"},{"title":"Your First API Call | DeepSeek API Docs","url":"https://api-docs.deepseek.com/"},{"title":"How to Build AI Agent Using DeepSeek","url":"https://www.prismetric.com/how-to-build-ai-agent-with-deepseek/"}]},"Based on the search results, I can provide you with information about using DeepSeek as a custom model provider with OpenAI-compatible Python frameworks, particularly with PydanticAI and the OpenAI Agents SDK.\n\n## Using DeepSeek with PydanticAI\n\nPydanticAI is model-agnostic and supports DeepSeek as one of the providers that's compatible with the OpenAI API.

In regular Python scripts, you'll need to use asyncio.run() to execute async functions:\n\n```python\n# Regular Python script\nimport asyncio\nfrom agents import Agent, Runner\n\nasync def main():\n    agent = Agent(\n        name=\"Test Agent\",\n        instructions=\"You are a helpful assistant that provides concise responses.\"\n    )\n    result = await Runner.run(agent, \"Hello! Are you working correctly?\")\n    print(result.final_output)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    asyncio.run(main())  # Run the async function\n```\n\nIn Jupyter notebooks, you should NOT use asyncio.run() because notebooks already have an event loop running. Instead, you can await async functions directly:\n\n```python\n# Jupyter notebook\nfrom agents import Agent, Runner\n\n# No need for asyncio.run() in notebooks\nagent = Agent(\n    name=\"Test Agent\",\n    instructions=\"You are a helpful assistant that provides concise responses.\"\n)\nresult = await Runner.run(agent, \"Hello! Are you working correctly?\")\nprint(result.final_output)\n```\n\n## Multi-Turn Conversations\n\nFor handling multi-turn conversations:\n\n```python\nasync def main():\n    agent = Agent(name=\"Assistant\", instructions=\"Reply very concisely.\")\n    \n    # First turn\n    result = await Runner.run(agent, \"What city is the Golden Gate Bridge in?\")\n    print(result.final_output)  # San Francisco\n    \n    # Second turn\n    new_input = result.to_input_list() + [{\"role\": \"user\", \"content\": \"What state is it in?\"}]\n    result = await Runner.run(agent, new_input)\n    print(result.final_output)  # California\n```\n\n## Important Notes\n\n1. When you call Runner.run(), it runs a loop until a final output is generated. The LLM is called with the model and settings on the agent, and the message history.

In regular Python scripts, you'll need to use asyncio.run() to execute async functions:\n\n```python\n# Regular Python script\nimport asyncio\nfrom agents import Agent, Runner\n\nasync def main():\n    agent = Agent(\n        name=\"Test Agent\",\n        instructions=\"You are a helpful assistant that provides concise responses.\"\n    )\n    result = await Runner.run(agent, \"Hello! Are you working correctly?\")\n    print(result.final_output)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    asyncio.run(main())  # Run the async function\n```\n\nIn Jupyter notebooks, you should NOT use asyncio.run() because notebooks already have an event loop running. Instead, you can await async functions directly:\n\n```python\n# Jupyter notebook\nfrom agents import Agent, Runner\n\n# No need for asyncio.run() in notebooks\nagent = Agent(\n    name=\"Test Agent\",\n    instructions=\"You are a helpful assistant that provides concise responses.\"\n)\nresult = await Runner.run(agent, \"Hello! Are you working correctly?\")\nprint(result.final_output)\n```\n\n## Multi-Turn Conversations\n\nFor handling multi-turn conversations:\n\n```python\nasync def main():\n    agent = Agent(name=\"Assistant\", instructions=\"Reply very concisely.\")\n    \n    # First turn\n    result = await Runner.run(agent, \"What city is the Golden Gate Bridge in?\")\n    print(result.final_output)  # San Francisco\n    \n    # Second turn\n    new_input = result.to_input_list() + [{\"role\": \"user\", \"content\": \"What state is it in?\"}]\n    result = await Runner.run(agent, new_input)\n    print(result.final_output)  # California\n```\n\n## Important Notes\n\n1. When you call Runner.run(), it runs a loop until a final output is generated. The LLM is called with the model and settings on the agent, and the message history. The LLM returns a response, which may include tool calls. If the response has a final output, it returns it and ends the loop.\n\n2. Some users have encountered 'AsyncOpenAI' object has no attribute 'responses' errors when using certain versions. Make sure you're using compatible versions of the OpenAI and agents SDKs.\n\n3. There's also a synchronous version available using Runner.run_sync() if you don't need async functionality:\n\n```python\nfrom agents import Agent, Runner\n\nagent = Agent(name=\"Assistant\", instructions=\"You are a helpful assistant\")\nresult = Runner.run_sync(agent, \"Write a haiku about recursion in programming.\")\nprint(result.final_output)\n```\n\nThis provides a complete overview of using async/await with OpenAI agents' Runner class, covering basic usage, tool integration, multi-agent workflows, and environment-specific considerations."],"durationSeconds":46.205232375000136}}

It's a production-ready upgrade of our previous experimentation for agents, Swarm.\n\n## Key Components Related to Your Query\n\n### 1. **RunContext and Configuration**\n\nThe OpenAI Agents SDK uses RunConfig for configuration rather than RunContext. RunConfig includes parameters like:\n- trace_metadata: Metadata to include on all traces\n- workflow_name, trace_id, group_id: Sets the tracing workflow name, trace ID and trace group ID for the run\n\nOther important RunConfig parameters include:\n- tracing_disabled: Allows you to disable tracing for the entire run\n- trace_include_sensitive_data: Configures whether traces will include potentially sensitive data, such as LLM and tool call inputs/outputs\n\n### 2. **Tracing System**\n\nThe Agents SDK automatically traces your agent runs, making it easy to track and debug the behavior of your agents. Tracing is extensible by design, supporting custom spans and a wide variety of external destinations, including Logfire, AgentOps, Braintrust, Scorecard, and Keywords AI.\n\n#### Trace Structure\nTraces represent a single end-to-end operation of a \"workflow\". They're composed of Spans. Traces have properties like workflow_name (the logical workflow or app, e.g., \"Code generation\" or \"Customer service\")\n\nAdditional trace properties include:\n- trace_id: A unique ID for the trace. Automatically generated if you don't pass one. Must have the format trace_<32_alphanumeric>\n- group_id: Optional group ID, to link multiple traces from the same conversation\n\n### 3. **Metadata and Session Management**\n\nWhen integrating with external tracing systems like Langfuse, you can include metadata:\n\nIn workflows, you can pass user_id, session_id, trace_tags and environment to Langfuse. You can also use the span attribute input.value and output.value to set the trace level input and output.\n\nExample from the search results shows how to set these attributes:\n```python\nspan.set_attribute(\"langfuse.user.id\", \"user-12345\")\nspan.set_attribute(\"langfuse.session.id\", \"my-agent-session\")\n```\n\n### 4. **Creating Traces with Metadata**\n\nYou can create a new trace using the trace() function. The trace will not be started automatically; you should either use it as a context manager (with trace(...):) or call trace.start() + trace.finish() manually. In addition to the workflow name and optional grouping identifier, you can provide an arbitrary metadata dictionary to attach additional user-defined information to the trace.\n\n### 5. **Trace Processing**\n\nAt initialization, a global TraceProvider is created, which is responsible for creating traces. It's configured with a BatchTraceProcessor that sends traces/spans in batches to a BackendSpanExporter, which exports the spans and traces to the OpenAI backend in batches.\n\nYou can customize tracing by:\n- add_trace_processor(): lets you add an additional trace processor that will receive traces and spans as they are ready\n- set_trace_processors(): lets you replace the default processors with your own trace processors\n\n### Important Note on PydanticAI vs OpenAI Agents SDK\n\nIt's worth noting that the search results show two different agent frameworks:\n1. **OpenAI Agents SDK** - Uses Runner, Agent, and RunConfig\n2. **PydanticAI** - Uses RunContext[T] with different syntax\n\nPydanticAI uses RunContext as shown in examples like:\n- @agent.tool async def roulette_wheel(ctx: RunContext[int], square: int) -> str:\n- def add_the_users_name(ctx: RunContext[str]) -> str:\n\nMake sure you're using the correct framework for your needs, as they have different APIs and patterns."}]},"uuid":"052bddb5-e233-4446-8d6b-680b86609bd7","timestamp":"2025-05-23T03:50:28.560Z","toolUseResult":{"query":"openai-agents python RunContext user_id session_id metadata tracing","results":["I'll search for information about OpenAI agents in Python, specifically focusing on RunContext, user_id, session_id, metadata, and tracing.",{"tool_use_id":"srvtoolu_01UBjUE7KfXdthBGScy5gz2f","content":[{"title":"Tracing - OpenAI Agents SDK","url":"https://openai.github.io/openai-agents-python/tracing/"},{"title":"GitHub - openai/openai-agents-python: A lightweight, powerful framework for multi-agent workflows","url":"https://github.com/openai/openai-agents-python"},{"title":"Trace the OpenAI Agents SDK with Langfuse - Langfuse","url":"https://langfuse.com/docs/integrations/openaiagentssdk/openai-agents"},{"title":"Running agents - OpenAI Agents SDK","url":"https://openai.github.io/openai-agents-python/running_agents/"},{"title":"OpenAI Agents SDK","url":"https://openai.github.io/openai-agents-python/"},{"title":"Setup - OpenAI Agents SDK","url":"https://openai.github.io/openai-agents-python/ref/tracing/setup/"},{"title":"Tracing module - OpenAI Agents SDK","url":"https://openai.github.io/openai-agents-python/ref/tracing/"},{"title":"Agents - PydanticAI","url":"https://ai.pydantic.dev/agents/"},{"title":"Creating traces/spans - OpenAI Agents SDK","url":"https://openai.github.io/openai-agents-python/ref/tracing/create/"},{"title":"Traces - OpenAI Agents SDK","url":"https://openai.github.io/openai-agents-python/ref/tracing/traces/"}]},"Based on the search results, I can provide you with comprehensive information about OpenAI agents in Python, specifically regarding RunContext, user_id, session_id, metadata, and tracing:\n\n## OpenAI Agents SDK Overview\n\nThe OpenAI Agents SDK enables you to build agentic AI apps in a lightweight, easy-to-use package with very few abstractions.
